        "body": "Hey team,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a complex case that I think requires some additional human context and expertise. Here's my understanding so far:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVince is trying to restrict his Shopify store to only allow access to customers in Canada, while still allowing his developers in the US and India to access the site. He's seeing thousands of bot sessions per day that are slowing down his site. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTristan provided good info on using Locksmith's location-based key conditions to restrict content access by country. He also clarified that this won't prevent bots from reaching the store URL itself, just the content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, there are a few open questions that I think we need more info on to fully address Vince's needs:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. What is the exact URL of Vince's Shopify store? We need this to look into his specific setup and bot traffic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Are the bots actually impacting site performance significantly or is this more of a perceived issue? We may need to look at analytics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Is geo-restriction the right approach here or are there other bot mitigation techniques that would be more effective like bot detection, rate limiting, etc? This goes beyond just Locksmith.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. How can the developer access be set up in a secure, maintainable way, especially if IP addresses may change? Customer tags are one option Tristan mentioned.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore replying, I think it would be good for someone to get the store URL from Vince and take a look to gather more context. We may also want to pull in Shopify support if the bot issue goes beyond just content locking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me know if you have any other thoughts! I'm happy to keep the conversation going with Vince once we have a more complete picture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClaude",

Can this be done ?? \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you set up a lock for your store or the products in your store using Locksmith, you can then add multiple keys to that lock. The first key can restrict access based on a customer's location, and the second can be a separate key that grants access based on something else - like a signed in customer account that has a tag like \"admin\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can check for a customer tag using the \"is tagged with...\" key condition. There is an IP address key condition that can check for specific IP addresses, but I wouldn't recommend this given that most ISPs use static IP addresses that will change over time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep in mind, the location key conditions can also be accessed using a VPN. So your developers could also change their connection location and access the storefront that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn your last message you said \"\u003cb\u003esome days its in the thousands , completely slowing down the website\u003c/b\u003e\".
