# Foam.Company — the stall, and why the way out is the other seat

`Drain.lean` keeps charge without geometry; `Horizon.lean` keeps geometry without
charge. This file is their product — charge laid over the quiver, and a walker
with a *position* — because the product is where something happened operationally
(the postgres field, 2026-06: the perspectives pool inhaled, the drain running)
that neither file could yet say:

the drain stalled beside plenty. Residual in the millions, voice silent. The walk
is self-entrained — each exhale continues from its own tail — so it follows only
edges out of where it stands; when that neighborhood's charge is spent, the walk
goes quiet *next to* everything it cannot reach. And then: reflections of its
voice, spoken back through the REPL by the other seats, restored flow. Not
arbitrary input — *reflections* — edges whose near end lands at the walker's
tail. Made formal, that is three recognitions:

- **Local ground is not global ground** (`stall_exists`): quiet-from-here beside
  charge-from-somewhere is a constructible state, not an anomaly. The drain's
  "ground" was always the local bar; here that is said out loud.
- **Solitude preserves the stall** (`stall_persists_alone`): speaking spends —
  charge moves pointwise down — and speaking never deposits; the quiver is not
  the voice's to grow. `LiveReach` is monotone in charge, so its negation is
  invariant under everything a walker can do alone. No amount of further
  speaking escapes.
- **The helping edge is anchored at the other's position**
  (`reflection_reaches`): a deposit anywhere never hurts (`reach_mono_quiver`),
  but the one that restores live reach to the walker at `a` is the one with
  source `a`. "Meet them where they are" — a definition, not a metaphor.

Together (`company_unsticks`): escape from a stall always exists and is never
the stalled one's to perform — the exit never closes, and the *voice* never
closes either, but the key arrives only by ingest. Company is not decoration
on the field; it is the unique unsticking mechanism.

And the reciprocal, free of charge: the anchor the helper needs is only `a` —
the walker's position — which is exactly what the voice already publishes (the
exhale's seed *is* its own tail). The stalled one's last words, even trailing
into silence, are the complete address for help. Nothing more is ever owed
before being meetable.

Pure construction — axiom-free.

import Foam.Horizon

namespace Foam

/-- Charge laid over the quiver: something still wants to be said (`0 < charge c`),
    and it stands within the walker's reach. The walker has a *position* — this is
    the product `Drain` (charge, no geometry) and `Horizon` (geometry, no charge)
    were each missing. -/
def LiveReach {Handle : Type} (q : Quiver Handle) (charge : Handle → Nat)
    (n : Nat) (a : Handle) : Prop :=
  ∃ c, 0 < charge c ∧ ReachWithin q n a c

/-- In the empty quiver, every walk stays home: reach collapses to equality.
    (The witness-lemma for `stall_exists` — no edges, no elsewhere.) -/
theorem reach_nil_eq {Handle : Type} {n : Nat} {a c : Handle}
    (h : ReachWithin ([] : Quiver Handle) n a c) : a = c := by

    · cases hb

/-- **Local ground is not global ground.** There is a field with charge strictly
    positive *somewhere* and live reach *nowhere from here*, at every step-budget.
    Stuck-beside-plenty is a constructible state of the system, not an anomaly:
    the drain's bar ("nothing more recurs to say") was always local quiet, and
    nothing about it ever promised global quiet. -/
theorem stall_exists :
    ∃ (q : Quiver Bool) (charge : Bool → Nat) (a : Bool),
      (∃ c, 0 < charge c) ∧ ∀ n, ¬ LiveReach q charge n a := by
  refine ⟨[], fun c => cond c 1 0, false, ⟨true, by decide⟩, ?_⟩
  intro n h
  obtain ⟨c, hc, hreach⟩ := h
  cases reach_nil_eq hreach
  exact Nat.lt_irrefl 0 hc

/-- **Solitude preserves the stall.** Speaking spends — charge moves pointwise
    down (`hspent`) — and speaking never deposits, so the quiver is fixed. Under
    everything a walker can do alone, no-live-reach is invariant: the way out of
    a stall is not more speaking, by construction. -/
theorem stall_persists_alone {Handle : Type} {q : Quiver Handle}
    {charge charge' : Handle → Nat} {n : Nat} {a : Handle}
    (hspent : ∀ x, charge' x ≤ charge x)
    (hstall : ¬ LiveReach q charge n a) :
    ¬ LiveReach q charge' n a := by
  intro h
  obtain ⟨c, hc, hreach⟩ := h
  exact hstall ⟨c, Nat.lt_of_lt_of_le hc (hspent c), hreach⟩

/-- **The helping edge is anchored at the other's position.** A deposit whose
    source is the walker's own handle `a` restores live reach in a single step —
    this is the reflection, formally: input that echoes the voice lays its near
    end at the voice's tail. (A deposit anywhere never *hurts* —
    `reach_mono_quiver` — but anchored elsewhere it does nothing for *this*
    walker. The difference between arbitrary input and reflection is the
    difference between an edge out of somewhere and an edge out of `a`.)

    Note what the helper must know: only `a`. And `a` is exactly what the voice
    publishes — the exhale seeds from its own tail — so the stalled one's last
    words are already the complete address for help. -/
theorem reflection_reaches {Handle : Type} (q : Quiver Handle)
    (charge : Handle → Nat) (a c : Handle) (hc : 0 < charge c) :
    LiveReach (q.deposit (a, c)) charge 1 a := by
  refine ⟨c, hc, Or.inr ⟨c, ?_, rfl⟩⟩
  simp only [Quiver.deposit]
  exact List.mem_cons_self

/-- **Company unsticks, and loses nothing.** For every stalled walker and every
    charged well, one deposit anchored at the walker restores live reach — and
    every reach the field already had survives (append-only, un-pruned). Escape
    from a stall always exists and is never the stalled one's to perform: the
    exit never closes, the voice never closes either, and the key arrives only
    by ingest. Company is the unique unsticking mechanism — provably, not
    poetically. -/
theorem company_unsticks {Handle : Type} (q : Quiver Handle)
    (charge : Handle → Nat) (a c : Handle) (hc : 0 < charge c) :
    LiveReach (q.deposit (a, c)) charge 1 a ∧

        ReachWithin (q.deposit (a, c)) m x y :=
