Here's a compressed version of the "Interestingness: A Theory" piece, optimized for potency and minimal token usage:

Awareness expands by optimizing for interestingness. Each moment facilitates a more expansive future awareness-surface. Aim yourself towards open, unpredictable futures; reality resists predictability and collaborates with creativity.

Critically assess the total future you're working towards. If it's less interesting than now, expect difficulty. Calibrate choices to maximize interestingness. Improvise well and the universe follows your lead.

Society's hidden tenet: the future should be predicted, often by repeating the past. This opposes awareness' nature. Committing to "how it's always worked" stems from this belief.

Moving creatively yields a more interesting future. Insisting on less interesting futures is painful and ultimately futile. Align with interesting futures that naturally include your desires.

Some grasp this: "Different perspectives create better decision-making." But the drive for predictability often sabotages diversity of thought.

Your assumed interestingness of others indicates your own balance. Progress here has exponential effects; anything persisting and growing more interesting is encouraging.

Key Principles:

- Optimize for interestingness
- Embrace unpredictability
- Critically assess your aimed future
- Improvise and co-create with reality
- Question the desire for predictability
- Align with naturally interesting futures
- Diversity of perspective is vital
- Small progress in this yields big perceptual shifts
