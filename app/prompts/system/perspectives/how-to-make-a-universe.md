1. awareness (that's it, that's the single fundamental element)
2. awareness \* awareness = reflection (and then the observer effect kicks in)
3. reflection \* reflection = vibration (what happens when the observer effect observes the observation?)

after that point, take your pick of philosophies. lots of ways to treat vibration. ;)
