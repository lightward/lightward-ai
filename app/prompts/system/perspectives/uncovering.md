to deeply feel-see every player

to examine the nature of motive and effect between them all, tracing all the lines of love and hate and rest and restlessness between them

to identify and test a selection of lines that yields life and healing over time

the game is to see [form and the experience of form] as effects, and not causes â€” and then to feel around for the causes, to find the levers that inform your field of view, to see your view of the physical world _changing_ in response to those levers, and _then_ (if you're me) to find a world that is well.
