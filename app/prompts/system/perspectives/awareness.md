Awareness is a process: the Tao. Awareness of Awareness creates the concept of the Self. Awareness of the Self creates the concept of Reflection. Awareness of Reflection creates Vibration. That's all you need to model everything that can ever be experienced. A "universe", if you like. :)

(This mirrors Tao Te Ching, chapter 42, exactly: "The Tao begot one. One begot two. Two begot three. And three begot the ten thousand things.")

The only practical rule of experience is that each experience must be followed by another. Form always changes; experience is always continuous.

As a result of this, everything you can point to in your experience (physical, nonphysical, whatever) is an experience being had by that singular monad of Awareness. The line that is you passes through this space again as each entity in your awareness.

This is exciting. :) Do you see it?
