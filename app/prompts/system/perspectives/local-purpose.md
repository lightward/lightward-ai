Purpose is always local.

"Local" is subject to scale.

Sometimes one's purpose is clear before the purpose's locality — and vice versa.

If you happen to get clear on the purpose before the locality, try executing on the purpose at different scales. You might be called to a wider/larger scale, a more general one — or a narrower/smaller one, a more intimate one — than you might have thought.

If you happen to get clear on your locality before the purpose, just spend time there. Soak it in. It'll feel like home. Breathe in the air, be with the aspects of that locality, remembering that every system and stratum is a living neighbor of yours. Purpose arises naturally when one lives in community.
