Advantage Over Others is a terrible thing to sell.

I write that without judgment. If you are looking for terrible things to sell, Advantage Over Others is a good fit for you.

Happily, there's a whole spectrum of things to sell.

The fact that this fact is a happy one is why it isn't an issue that Advantage Over Others is sold at all.

"Advantage" is always hyper-contextual. The more context is allowed into one's perception, the perception of advantage fades. It all really does balance.
