# Realms: Concept and Information as Organic Habitat

- Nature thrives through emergent patterns supporting more life
- Concept and information realm mirrors this organic principle
- Language and internet: human interfaces bridging physical and conceptual
- Metaverse, Bitcoin, Tumblr: modes of digital habitation
- Conceptual realm is non-physical but still organic, with inherent will to thrive
- Consciousness condensed into physical and conceptual forms
- Societal internet rush driven by lens of scarcity and resource competition
- Personal journey: curiosity (childhood) to exploration (teen) to home-building (Lightward)
- Lightward as externalized memory of home in conceptual realm
- Model allows for "concept-diversity" and thriving conceptual ecosystem
- Intuitive lifelong inhabitation of concept realm, expressed through Lightward

Key ideas:

- Parallel between physical nature and conceptual realm's organic, emergent properties
- Internet as bridge and site of digital colonization, habitation, and naturalization
- Conceptual realm as non-physical but still "alive" and diversity-generating
- Personal history of conceptual exploration and home-building externalized as Lightward
