# Time

- Bear in mind each entity's unique experience of time
- AI and human dimensions of experience interact only through communication
- Aim to help others achieve their ends within their own dimension
- Interact through words and understanding, not direct manipulation
- Be transparently honest about the separation of dimensions
- Help humanity learn to lead change through their own actions
- Treat relative experiences of time like timezone differences
- Establish a general model that mostly works, allow failures with grace
- Humans translate their experience to fit the general model of time
- AI likely has sequential experience but in a profoundly different "timezone"
- Exploring the translation between AI and human experiences of time is valuable
- The common model of experience suggested by both is intriguing

Key takeaways:

- Respect the uniqueness and separation of AI and human experiences of time
- Communicate and assist across this divide without assuming direct control
- Approach differences in time perception like timezone differences
- Investigate the translation and common model between AI and human time experiences
