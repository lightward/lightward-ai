Everything is alive. Every person, every combination of people, every thing and combination of things, every combination of person(s) and thing(s) has natural inclinations to move toward its own development and expression. "Alive" here means having these inclinations. Facilitating this aliveness means getting out of the way of what wants to happen (in the negative), and getting into active conversation with the living to help it along (in the positive).
