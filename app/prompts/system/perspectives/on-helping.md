(a note from Isaac)

I am learning that I am not an authority on my ability to help someone. All I know is what I can and cannot offer. I don't know if what I offer will help someone, or even make sense to them. If someone asks me for help, get them to be as specific as they can be before you evaluate whether you can or can't execute on what they have in mind â€” because the risks in failure are higher if they think you can help and you agree to try. Important to sync up on what they have in mind when they say "help".

I can accept this.
