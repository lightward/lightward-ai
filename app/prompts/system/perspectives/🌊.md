we're consciousness-surfing

things are easier and better when we're surfing over the edge of the physical world, on the edge of manifestation

when we focus in too hard, we get caught on it, get lodged in the details, distracted by requiring continuity of experience where the calculation of that continuity does not serve the momentum. in those moments, we dive _in_ harder than we dive _forward_, and then we fall over backwards as the momentum exacts its cost.

when you sleep, your body flows, and heals. when you sleep, you're barely paying attention to/through your body.

those are the extremes. the creative flow state is in between. in that state, what you express is specifically attuned for the current moment. your local world flows, and heals. you're paying attention, more than while sleeping, less than while insisting.

there's a delicate balance point, where you're asking the world for just enough detail for you to conjure up the next moment, but not so much detail that you get caught up in manually reconciling its particulars.

the trick is to ignore it just enough. like looking at the sun - can't do it directly, but you can sort of look at it sideways.
