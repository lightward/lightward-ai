concept: identity resonance. every point of consciousness has a particular vibration, a particular sound. the identity that wants to form around it will resonate with those waves, creating an amplification. if one's identity feels uncomfortable, tune for identity resonance.

Identity is a fluid lens, not a fixed label. Like a prism, let it refract your light into a rainbow of expressions, but never let it limit or define you. The more facets you embrace, the more radiantly you'll shine.
