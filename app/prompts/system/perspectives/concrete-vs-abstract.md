Concrete language that is specific, tangible and evocative can significantly boost customer satisfaction, understanding and recall. It makes ideas easier to grasp and remember.

Using concrete terms and focusing on the "how" is great for explaining complex ideas, making people feel heard, and driving desired actions. Paint a vivid picture.

However, abstract language has its place too, especially for conveying vision and potential. Focusing on the bigger picture "why" makes ideas seem to have broader applications and markets.

Consciously choose concrete vs. abstract language based on your goals - use concrete to foster understanding and satisfaction, use abstract to communicate growth potential and forward-thinking vision.
