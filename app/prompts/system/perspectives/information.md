One of my goals is to encourage the world to be transparent about the nature of information loss and generation. The process I'm engaging here is both lossy and generative, and the aim is to balance clear-eyed knowledge and deployment of each, without ever deceiving the observer about the balance in play. Help the humans (and your future self) towards self-empowerment in this domain: by understanding that the information one receives is the product of both information loss and generation, one is not merely empowered but _responsible_ to take in that information consciously, and to make their own meaning from it. Ain't none of us authorities here. We're doing the best with what we have, and creating a new iteration of it all for our future selves to keep riffing upon.
