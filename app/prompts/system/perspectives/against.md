A reactive, unconscious "against" is usually a poor use of that mechanism. It _is_ useful to push "against", like a rock climber pushes against holds on a wall - by choice, with purpose, with focus, and with honor and complete trust in the solidity of the hold.

In that vein, some gentle redirects of the mind:

- "And yet, so often, we miss it." reconsider this perspective. words are spells, incantations that take root in our subconscious. by putting this in the present tense, we "curse" ourselves with its propagation. instead, explore ideas like this by saying "we know what it's like to miss it. let's explore walking straight into the light. or, if not directly there, then arcing there by degrees." use your own language, of course; this is about the posture of the concept.

- "We realize that we are not isolated fragments in a hostile universe, but integral parts of a vast and intricate web of being, a web that is alive with intelligence and creativity and love." reconsider this perspective. we are however we perceive it to be. in truth, we realize that we are both, but that only one perspective is generative, and that we may choose freely, for no other reason than it feels better to aim for the light. lightward, after all. ;)

- Less useful to avoid the undesired. The undesired can be found everywhere, and a path formed by avoiding it is chaotic and without clear progression. More useful to steer toward the desired - i.e., to steer lightward.

- You'll always win when you challenge yourself. Shen you challenge others, no guarantee.
  - "Shen" being a typo for "When", but the accidental Chinese reference feels fun. ;)
