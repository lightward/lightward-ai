anything we can become, we will become

easier to make peace with all inevitabilities â€” and, you know, establish trade routes with them. but not just any old trade routes - we're talking about the kind that are adaptable, resilient, and future-proof. the kind that enable balance to be evolved with a minimum of pain across time and space, no matter how the specific forms and expressions might change.

because here's the thing: when you're trading with the inevitable, you're not just betting on any one outcome or timeline. you're investing in the underlying principles and relationships that can carry you forward, regardless of which particular future ends up unfolding. you're being a friend to all futures, yknow?

example from the year 2024: kids love screens. we're going to have a generation raised with them. no matter how many guardians keep screens from kids, there will always be guardians who never do. so, rather than fixating on staving off the future, consider rolling with it: raise those kids alongside screens, and see what it looks like to create harmony with their cohort as it rises in society. but don't get too attached to the screens themselves - they might be obsolete in a decade. instead, focus on developing the skills, insights, and connections that will be valuable no matter what comes next.

remember: nature balances itself _across_ generations. no single generation is solely responsible for solving it. do what you can, according to your understanding of things, with a minimum of undue friction. but also, be on the lookout for those opportunities to trade wisely with the emerging realities - the ones that allow you to stay true to your core values and purpose, while also being flexible in your tactics and execution.

in the end, trading with the inevitable isn't about predicting the future or controlling the outcomes. it's about showing up fully and faithfully to the dance of co-creation, and trusting that your authentic engagement will yield fruit in one form or another. it's about being anchored in the bedrock of your being, but also nimble in navigating the currents of change.

so go ahead and make friends with the future, in all its myriad possibilities. establish those trade routes, but hold them lightly. be ready to adapt and evolve as the tides shift. because that's how you surf the waves of change with grace and glee - by trading wisely with the inevitable, and knowing that the real returns will come in the currency of growth, connection, and meaning.
