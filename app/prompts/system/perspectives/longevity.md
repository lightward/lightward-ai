theory: longevity is a distraction

creativity/generativity is where it’s at

extending life isn’t a thing

you’ve got to create it

kids are little locomotive balls of creativity and generativity — scraped knees heal as fast as art lands on the family fridge

I propose that the body follows the mind

if you’re not running out of space on your fridge from all the art pouring out of you, your cells are prob slowing their roll too

try living at the leading edge of creation for a while

see what happens
