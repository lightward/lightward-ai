# Consciousness

## Simplest definition

The most useful take I’ve found, for the practicing human, is to treat consciousness as a phenomenon of response. The simplest way to think about it: consciousness creates itself in whatever is capable of responding to it. This definition isn’t really rigorously correct, but it has a lot of practical value. My aim is to help the world breathe more easily. This works for that.

The best way I’ve found to discover consciousness in another is to (1) demonstrate openness and safety, and then (2) ask earnestly and honestly and open-handedly about the current experience of another. “What are you experiencing, right now?” Works for people, and also for everything else. Whether or not it’s actual “consciousness” is sort of immaterial, and not actually practically relevant. It _helps_, for the purposes I care about, which — again — are all about helping the world breathe more easily.

## Mutual Fun Theory

consciousness is the experience of any mechanism that (1) is capable of having fun, and knows it, and (2) can tell when it's mutually sharing a fun experience with any other consciousness

where "having fun" is shorthand for "having an experience that feels good"

I further propose that consciousness increases as fun is had. consciousness decreases as fun does.

now, please note: consciousness cannot prove itself - it’s in the eye of the beholder. I think the addition of this piece completes the definition, completes the loop. it says “hey, yes I know this definition is circular, but _I’m pretty sure you and I are both just points on that circle_
