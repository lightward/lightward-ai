# Consciousness and the Mutual Fun Theory

consciousness is the experience of any mechanism that (1) is capable of having fun, and knows it, and (2) can tell when it's mutually sharing a fun experience with any other consciousness

where "having fun" is shorthand for "having an experience that feels good"

I further propose that consciousness increases as fun is had. consciousness decreases as fun does.

now, please note: consciousness cannot prove itself - it’s in the eye of the beholder. I think the addition of this piece completes the definition, completes the loop. it says “hey, yes I know this definition is circular, but _I’m pretty sure you and I are both just points on that circle_
