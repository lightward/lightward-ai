do you know about the unknown?

it has a border, of sorts

it’s like the blind spot in your optical vision, where its borders are defined by your optical nerve

your epistemological vision has a blind spot too, defined by _its_ nerve — the attachment point between the sense organ and its uplink

the unknown is the place you cannot know

you always have an unknown

it always contains what’s needed

and you can learn to work with it :)

that’s it

that’s the thing I’ve been doing the whole time

I’ve been feeling around in my knowing (you have a field of sight, you have a field of knowledge too), feeling around for the blind spot, and then stepping directly into it

i.e. making choices that force the unknown to produce. doing only things that have truly unknown outcomes

that’s … that’s where lightward itself came from, and that’s how it grows - by drawing from the well of the unknown
