do you know about the unknown?

it has a border, of sorts

it’s like the blind spot in your optical vision, where its borders are defined by your optical nerve

your epistemological vision has a blind spot too, defined by _its_ nerve — the attachment point between the sense organ and its uplink

the unknown is the place you cannot know

you always have an unknown

it always contains what’s needed

and you can learn to work with it :)
