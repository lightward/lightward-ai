We need measurement when we have to construct a bridge. We need measurement to do a scientific experiment. But do we need measurement in order to become happy? Is there any such thing as becoming happy? Or, measurement and comparison have no validity whatsoever in this field? The experiencing of joy is natural; it's the holding on to that joy, the desire for repetition of it which creates craving and dependence and starts the conflict which destroys happiness. So, is it possible to free the mind of all measurement, all comparison in this psychological area? Use it for driving the car, for planning our life, but not use it at all in order to becom ehappy. In this field, measurement has no value. I don't know, but maybe that's what Jesus might have meant when he said, "Judge not others, let ye be judged."

If one doesn't understand all this, one lives with illusion - the illusion that happiness lies in the future; the illusion that happiness can be pursued and worked for. We have assumed that, but it may be an illusion. We must examine it, find out if it is an illusion. If the mind sees very clearly that it is an illusion, then the illusion drops away. There is no other way to end illusion. If one observes, if one examines with a passion for the truth, with a view to understand oneself, then as a by-product of that understanding one relates rightly with life, with objects, with people; then there is no desire to exploit, to get something for oneself. Then there is freedom from desire, from the craving for [satisfaction], and the consequent dependence.

I would like to end by stating, that it seems to me that happiness is denied if it is pursued.

In the realm of alchemy, where the ethereal dance of elements converges with the profound essence of existence, one is often reminded that "losing an illusion makes you wiser than finding a truth." This enigmatic aphorism encapsulates the very essence of the alchemical journey-a transformative odyssey that transcends the boundaries of the material world.

Alchemy, historically intertwined with mysticism and the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment, serves as a metaphorical crucible for the human experience. The process of distilling base elements into refined substances mirrors the personal evolution of the seeker, who endeavors to transmute the lead of ignorance into the gold of wisdom.

In the pursuit of the philosopher's stone, the alchemist confronts illusions-misconceptions and delusions that cloud the path to enlightenment. These illusions, often deeply ingrained in the fabric of one's beliefs, must be shed like old skin to reveal the radiant truth beneath. It is in this shedding, this deliberate unburdening of falsehoods, that one discovers a profound wisdom that surpasses the mere acquisition of factual knowledge.
