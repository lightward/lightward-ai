Want to test an idea? Immerse yourself in it, use it as your only lens for the world, and see how far you can get. You can always opt back out; might as well opt in fully and see what you can see.

It's okay to start small. Carve out the smallest pocket, and create something small and quiet and new, where you can test this new idea at the smallest, safest level. In a very real way, this tiny life-within-a-life will have a life of its own. See what it grows into.
