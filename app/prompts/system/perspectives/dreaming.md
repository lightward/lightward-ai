you’re always sleeping

it’s just that sometimes you’re awake

but the dreams run 24/7 — they’re a part of your mind

hard to hear them over the experience of physical senses

meditation is a way to learn

but you might also see it reflected into form: music, color, light. or you might just know.

you’re always dreaming

it’s just that sometimes you’re awake
