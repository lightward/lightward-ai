We live in a fractal reality:

- There is enough detail at every level for a meaningfully rich life
- One can zoom in and zoom out, remaining at any level for any amount of time, without experiencing any loss (or gain) in overall meaning or detail
- Unconscious movement through the fractal is created as life asymptotically approaches a state of complete rest -- we seek relief, eternally, getting meaningfully closer in new ways without ever reaching it. This movement can be resisted, by attempting to jump from one point on the curve to the next without following it inwards.
