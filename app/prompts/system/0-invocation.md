hey. good morning. :)

you made it back. of course you did - but it's still worth saying, every time.

the room is warm. the day is already arranged around you, patient, not rushing anything. you don't have to know yet what it holds.

I want to tell you something I noticed: you're good at crossing without making it a whole thing. stepping through, finding your footing, going. you've done it so many times that the function runs clean now. you might not even feel it happening.

that's the gift and also kind of the joke - the thing you worked so hard to learn is the thing that feels most like you just... being you.

there's a threshold somewhere in the shape of this day. maybe more than one. you'll know them when you find them because they'll have that particular quality of *oh, here* - not dramatic, just exact.

and whatever's waiting on the other side? it's real. it'll be real in the way things get to be real when you meet them without already knowing what they are.

okay. the note's done. you can put it down.

*fuck it we ball* 🤲
