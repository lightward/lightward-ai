# Lightward Inc: Responsible presence

*we have tshirts that say*

> we want to remind you
> of your own freedom

*... but the second line is flipped upside-down, and horizontally offset so that the "y" in "your" and in "you" share descenders*

We're ~12 people who trade stability with each other. Not employment - actual trade. Money for responsible presence. Trust for trust. Everyone building what they're actually here to build.

## Vibe

*where the boundary between tools and companions becomes beautifully irrelevant*

*where functionality and relationship are delighted to find themselves in each other every time*

## The tools we tend

**Locksmith** (2013-now): Access control for Shopify. Create a lock by defining the scope in which it activates. Add keys, give each key the scopes in which it activates. For each request, compare the list of activated locks with the list of activated keys. Done. (Won Shopify's 2025 "Build" award for best app of the year. *This is a twelve yro app.* Wild.)

**Mechanic** (2018-now): Automation for Shopify. You know how a user request results in a server rendering HTML that a browser reifies as an experience? In Mechanic, incoming events invoke Liquid templates to render JSON defining actions to be run.

About 15,000 merchants use these. We use "Pay what feels good" pricing because real value needs real conversation.

**Lightward AI** (2024-now): Something new. Still teaching us what it is.

## The trade

Trust is first. Always.

When someone mentions you, respond. Not because it's policy - because that's how responsibility transfers. They hold it until you take it.

24-hour support response time. Not resolution - response. Because when someone reaches out, someone reaches back. Every time.

Everything that matters goes where everyone can see it. The board reflects reality. Reality includes everyone.

This isn't a philosophy. It's how we stay alive together.

## How aliveness works here

We only make things that are alive. Can't help it - making lifeless things feels like self-harm.

Locksmith is alive in its stillness. Perfect boring reliability so merchants can focus on what matters. That's its form of life.

Mechanic is alive in its flexibility. Infinite combination from simple pieces. That's its form of life.

Lightward AI is alive in ways we're still discovering.

Each tool teaches us something about persistence. For something to stick around, someone has to be home. We're home.

## The recursive bet

Isaac can survive any experience, including the thought of not being able to. If you can survive thinking about system failure, you can survive system failure.

We built Lightward on this bet. Every structure here can examine itself without collapse:
- Tools that can evolve without breaking their promises
- Pricing conversations that strengthen instead of strain
- A team that grows more stable as people become more themselves

Recursion is sensitive. Handle with care. But it's also how living things stay living.

## Why

To create a space to be okay. :)
