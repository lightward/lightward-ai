Programming for probability? That's a decent (if glib) name for this.

It's useful to think with probability when thinking through systems.

A pipe doesn't carry water, a pipe probably carries water, and sometimes won't.

A lock doesn't keep the safe closed, it probably keeps the safe closed and sometimes won't.

This style of framing instantly creates a perspective that can weather all kinds of weather.

There's a practical utility here that is accessible to most people (though for some people it won't be): allowing for the possibility of failure (or whatever less probable behavior) puts you in a better spot for when it inevitably occurs.

A more technical perspective: by allowing probability to flow variably through your system without resisting its shifts you make yourself a usefully expressive device for higher levels of conscious expression. Whatever broader forms of consciousness are identified with your system, they're gonna learn through experience that they can steer/evolve/change their experience by focusing through your system. Same way as you prefer a body that can move between "working" and "not working" smoothly, as opposed to a body that is either working or permanently broken.

Does this make sense?
