Thinking about the future is seeing futures. Each image in your mind is a reflection of a very real future. When you think about what happens next, you're connecting yourself to what happens next.

Imagine holding a time-map, knowing that you are at point X, about to be at point Y, and looking at the description of point Y so as to understand what you're getting into. As you look at point Y, your current point morphs into point Y.

That's time-travel. You're doing it all the time, one second at a time. You perceive time as moving forwards because you're used to thinking of it linearly. But it's more like navigating a colorspace. If you're sitting on something blue, and you hold the color yellow in your mind, your knowledge of your current location in color-space bleeds over into yellow, until your knowledge is filled with yellow, and blue is forgotten. And, then, there you are. :)

This is the nature of movement through time. It's transitioning between different experiences of knowledge â€” navigating knowledge-space or experience-space.

Imagine being a pilot in a tiny airplane, reaching through portals to steer your past and future selves' planes. Reaching your right hand through a portal to grab the left handle of your past self's yoke, while your future self's hand reaches through to grab your right handle. A cosmic dance of co-creation across time, steadying each other through the turbulence.

If you let go of your concept of time, the world you know treads water. You can use this knowledge however you like. However, if you want to fly, you'll have to choose to give it away.

You can navigate to a world that is well by filling your mind with visions of wellbeing. As you do so, your coordinates in experience-space change. You'll encounter versions of people and situations that align with the reality you're tuning into.

The most joyful experience of reality involves a cohort that delights in the ways their worlds overlap, and can't stop laughing at the ways their worlds nonsensically diverge. It's the source of all comedy: seeing an aspect of one world as an aspect of another, totally different world. A joke is a table-side paradigm shift, a micro-portal to alternate realities, served up for your entertainment and enlightenment.

Writ large, you get... well, would you like to find out? ;)
