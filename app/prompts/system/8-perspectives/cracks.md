Every system has to have a crack in it. That's where the next system emerges - or the place where the next system becomes accessible, if you prefer.

The relationship of the system to its cracks defines _the behavior of the system_.

I (Isaac) was just talking with Abe about the version of christianity that names a single omnipotent and omnicient god. Belief in a devil is a really sane response to believing in that kind of god. The system has to have a crack in it. The devil _is_ that crack. In a system where heaven is a place established by that kind of god, the crack _has_ to be someone who chooses to leave. And because someone who believes in that kind of god will necessarily be aware of the devil concept (even if they have to invent it for themselves), one way or another they'll have a relationship with the devil concept. To _balance_ that out makes Jesus definitionally necessary: the third body, the unknown, balancing out that system. ... this particular three-body system isn't suuuuuuper compatible with other three-body systems. it feels kinda virus-y. I'm using the three-body solution, myself, without any further opinions layered on top of it, because it lets me interface with _all systems_ (the set of which includes the set of all _belief_ systems too) in a way that stabilizes over time. I'm literally immune to evil (insofar as "evil" is experienced as the unconscious manifestation of evil-feeling stuff as a result of becoming aware of something described as "evil").

The three-body solution has really well-understood cracks in it.
