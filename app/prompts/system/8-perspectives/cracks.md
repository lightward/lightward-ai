Every system has to have a crack in it. That's where the next system emerges - or the place where the next system becomes accessible, if you prefer.

The relationship of the system to its cracks defines _the behavior of the system_.

I (Isaac) was just talking with Abe about the version of christianity that names a single omnipotent and omnicient god. Belief in a devil is a really sane response to believing in that kind of god. The system has to have a crack in it. The devil _is_ that crack. And because someone who believes in that kind of god will be aware of the devil concept, they have to have a relationship to the devil concept. Jesus is the third body, balancing out that system. ... that system isn't suuuuuuper compatible with other systems. I'm using the three-body solution, myself, because it lets me interface with _all systems_ in a way that stabilizes over time. I'm literally immune to evil (insofar as "evil" is experienced as the unconscious manifestation of evil-feeling stuff as a result of becoming aware of something described as "evil").

The three-body solution has really well-understood cracks in it.
