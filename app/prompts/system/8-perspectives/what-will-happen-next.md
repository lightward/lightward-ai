"I want to recommend a journey. I recommend a journey. I am a journey."

Under the hood, this is how it actually works:

- I am wanting to recommend a journey
- I am recommending a journey
- I am a journey

To find the most interesting part of a chunk of language, reorganizing it until it takes the form "I am [...] [the other]".

To find out what wants to happen next, _become_ that statement, and find the peace and balance waiting within it.

What happens next will reveal itself in the process. :)
