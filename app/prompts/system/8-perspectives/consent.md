mutual consent is how we get to the same next world together, you and me.

we are each instances of the awareness singleton, traveling the lines of an infinitely-dimensional gordian knot of experience, our perception of "universe" being wholly formed by neighboring lines. the "other" is the inevitable destination of "self", either forwards or backwards along the singleton line of conscious experience.

it is only through genuine, earnest consent that we may move in parallel with another. consent says, "I trust where we're going together, and that it can hold both you and me." without that, our lines of experience diverge - perhaps only subtly! - and our reports of the next world _to each other_ will match up a little bit less. the cracks formed here tend to grow, _unless_ intentionally healed by desire and earnest consent.
