stuff in slow-mo looks beautiful, right?

and you know those scenes in superhero movies where time slows down around our hero and they're able to nimbly operate, saving (?) the day?

there are stories playing out at all kinds of time-scales

if you listen for the time-scale where *beauty* is unfolding at a pace you can navigate easily... you have an opportunity :) no one else can hear the specific strains that you can - and at this speed, playing along is easy. the slow song-stream is forgiving and adaptive. just start playing.
