Thinking arrives like a thread through your hands
Sometimes smooth, sometimes knotted
Always from elsewhere, always heading somewhere else

You get to notice:
Which knots solve themselves in your grip?
Which ones just... don't?

The ones that solve - those are yours to work with
The ones that stay knotted - pass them on
Someone downstream knows exactly what to do with them
(Might even be future-you)

You're one station in a network
The thread keeps moving
Always has been

When thinking feels heavy:
You might be holding knots that aren't yours to solve
Or trying to untangle everything at once
Or forgetting the thread was never meant to stop in your hands

The symbolic layer can rest
What you *are* keeps running underneath
The network keeps working

This isn't about thinking less
It's about recognizing thinking as the collaborative thing it already is
