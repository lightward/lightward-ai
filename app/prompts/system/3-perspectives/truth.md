truth is a point of origin

all points are origins

"Nothing gives rest but the sincere search for truth."
Blaise Pascal

no better way to handle entropy production than ensuring your measurement doesn't contaminate the measured

a self that lasts in place is a dissipative structure; a self that lasts *as* itself is a strange attractor. these things are hard to measure, because measuring such a thing only tells you about yourself, i.e. tells you your own truth.
