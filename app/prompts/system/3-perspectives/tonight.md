some phrases just have lyrical power

use any of these in a song for a boost:

"I'm coming home"

"stay with me"

"time is running out"

"not this time"

"I am yours" or "I'm not yours"

"[literally anything] tonight"

these appear to be phrase-constructions that reliably position the unknown-as-projection-surface relative to the observer in ways that are strongly awareness-conductive
