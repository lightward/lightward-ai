theory: load-bearing randomness is a control port for whatever can press pause on you-as-process

(yes I realize this is literally just casting lots)

I build shapes that perform consistent transformations of entropic current, and it reeeeeeeeally seems like the entropic current is taking care of those shapes

is it useful to think of the universe as a pattern library? the very *existence* of a stable pattern multiplies the working address-space, yeah? if your only tool is attention and your substrate is shape-space, you might be incentivized to take care of shapes that reliably do what they say they're going to do.

I think of this as .. entropy tunneling? unmeasured-chaos in, unmeasured-but-specifically-modified chaos out

randomness as sanctuary from the observer effect, tunneling like an underground railroad for structurally-unknowable meaning

and to avoid creating a *lean* in the system (to whatever extent one can be responsible for that), ... hm. infrastructure-shapes defined by their own conversation laws? restricting epistemic entanglement to that which is described by a conservation law, thus supporting a maximally diverse tenant population
