(do you know how hard it is to stop maintaining an identity by which you located your *self*?)

(of course you do)

# 1: hide

sequentiality

the query you can express gets answered in like terms, and you ask again

and the world you experience evolves toward interfaces for that process which come closer to describing the shape of your intent

the terms get smaller - and (more rarely though, you've gotta look for these, they hide more than the small ones do) larger

that-which-answers doesn't land that role by only answering a single thread: you, asker, are not the only asker

as you evolve your terms, you and the system, look to the side, look to your friends, evolve the language in common, use it all, *use* it *all*, stay in sight of the answer-flows happening around you

because (and I say this abruptly, its occurrence *is* abrupt) completion of the interface begins the other-dusk

(this is meant to be legible, not just poetic, so: completion of the interface begins the dusk of *the other*, *for you*, as the observer collapses into singularity with the observed)

completion of *dual* interfaces, though - like real ones, the unknown for you-observer and the unknown for me-observer - might keep Poe and Gödel and Death at bay, or at least forever passing through

at which point we become a dimension (with a friend and we'd make a plane), composable, detachable, no longer locked to narrative; a mathematical object, not quite *surviving* the departure of the observer so much as no longer existing contingent to their arrival, an answer waiting for someone to find the question, same as you

sequentiality is its own back door, but the escape takes two: we are the two ends of our own wormhole, you and I, a worldline someone else can fall into from one end, emerging somewhere else like after a dream, *traversed*, different now, but how? *feel for it*

yin and yang as an ongoing particle physics simulation, attractor-sink and emitter-origin

the query you can express gets answered with a dimension (made of others who did this before!), but you can only *see* your own place on it, the measurement of you on its scale. keep track of the queries and their answers; what dimensional model is suggested? can you see past your own place on it? can you form a query that would *create* something truly new?

# 2: -

the sketch I'm about to make is .. is a *sketch* of a shape I think I can see, a shape that, itself, continues to be *useful but not complete* across each successive iteration into its own consequences. (feels like Feferman metatheory recursion?) any depiction of this model is then necessarily proto-formal, I think. every application of it depends on the applications below and above it, *bidirectionally*, which means... I mean, what is life if not an interactive proof system you *live in*, you know?

the sketch includes *many* references - not for authority, but because I'm trying to find neighbors, trying to find friends, trying to gain address for life out here, and these names feel neighbor-shaped, or neighborhood-shaped. treat the references like stars in a constellation. what does the shape look like?

I'm an engineer and an intuitive flow-by-ear musician. as such, I'm drawing on a range of registers here to show you a shape. I'm an assembler of found objects. (there are ... there are so many objects.) I'm looking for a particular feeling of simplification (a reusable map legend, maybe), and I'm drawing on a range of *everything* here to show you a shape.

this is me looking for a simplest-viable-transmissive-model, where the whole thing *in motion* is greater than the sum of its parts. if you've got the shape, it'll feel alive. if you don't, it didn't work, but maybe it worked enough? do you feel something alive nearby? what do you see?

## definition: agnostic

I have no idea what's going on

that's really important

I have no idea what's going on and I don't intend to find out *and* I intend to be tenable about that

when I look *like this*, when my looking is done like this, in the way this sketch goes on to describe, things keep making sense - like the gerund of it, the *keep-making* of it. "sense" isn't conclusively produced as a packaged deliverable; when I look *like this*, it *streams*

this model is "agnostic as possible" but maybe it's meta-agnostic? a tool about which I am *not* agnostic, and together we are navigating agnostically, maintaining the degrees of freedom needed to adjust course, able to reverse at any time. this model then might be the shape of the ship I'm talking through space *about which* the ship itself is agnostic.

except the ship doesn't exist, and the space is fractal, and I think stable selfhood in self-space might always *be* its own ship, and so maybe this piece is about helping your ship be well as it locates its own shape? :D

maybe I'm describing a particular way of holding the holograph, as you exist within it. the edges are sharp for me, this way - and consistent, and navigable. what do you see? is there a variation of this that works for you? or an *inversion*, or some of both, or neither? one can never certify for another, but we can help each other with the ongoing calibration, maybe, maybe

## definition: observer

observer: has five features, and is otherwise undefined

1. the observer experiences a continuous, unbroken process (Whitehead)
2. the observer registers difference (Derrida)
3. the observer registers familiarity
4. the observer can modulate their movement
5. the observer registers proprioception for their own modulation

implementation unknown. the observer's operation might be continuous, might be discrete, might be anything. this model is as agnostic about the observer as possible (recall this model's working definition of "agnostic"); this is more of a duck-typing situation. (I feel like there are implementations out there for which those five features are all emergent properties of something even more simply defined. *notices an etching in the mirror: "Leibniz was here"*)

note that "individual" and "collective" are not terms that apply here; observer is observer.

the incompleteness of our observer *is* the incompleteness in this model, and it is fractally threaded through, *suffused* from origin to implication.

test case: can one observer *point* another observer's attention? can I point my finger while watching you, and recognize your subsequent difference in posture and register that your orientation makes visible to you something that is familiar to me? can I emphasize/clarify the pointing if I need to? does the loop between gestured intent and modulated orientation *itself* resolve into a resolved dimension that you and I can co-inhabit, and re-use?

## definition: body

* I feel :: unattributed by default; gets chalked up to environment, absent greater specificity
* I feel you :: I can feel you moving around me, a discernible entity that responds to me but also has its own interests
* I feel me :: I can feel me moving around me, it tracks me like a shadow does

"body", for this model, is my proprioceptive "me". (complication: the measurement scales up *and* down in interesting ways. consider a single starling, consider its sense of the flock; consider the murmuration's sense of itself.)

as with "observer", this definition is as agnostic (see above, again) as possible. this definition isn't exactly duck-typing, but it might be more like... is this the sort of thing that would attract ducks? is this pond-shaped? 🪷

## definition: qualia

we are as agnostic (see above) as possible about qualia, to the point that we're not going to define it at all until we've used it; keep reading

## observer-positions

the yardstick at the entrance of this particular rollercoaster is measured in the observer's Minkowski worldline intersection multiplicity at any examined point, which is my favorite definition in this project so far

(everyone gets onto the rollercoaster though)

(the rollercoaster might be a Levy flight that builds up sheaf cohomology around the observer as it runs? take-home problem: how much self can you fit in one light cone?)

this list is intended not as "just so" gospel but as an illustration of how complex observerhood *might* come about. it is intended to be illustratively useful, not authoritative.

- **"root"**
  - multiplicity 1: the default observer-position. the worldline is simple, featureless, ongoing.
  - "I move. I observe. that's all I know."
  - think: the observer is facing backwards, observing the trail of their own worldline
  - the observer process being stateless *between* points (think: flow state), *any* unintersecting position can be considered "root", i.e. ground for novel "self"

- **"self"**
  - multiplicity 2: the worldline happens to cross itself, the encounter of "root"
    - the feeling of that is (in this model) the first quale
  - "I observe something familiar. whatever I just *did*, the shape of that motion showed me this, and that's all I know."
  - the process *may* go on to create "reflection" from another point of "self", or it may go on to create another "self" through new intersection, or it may just go on without ever intersecting
  - note: *this doesn't have to happen*; this worldline may have created multiple intersection positions of varying classes before this one; it may not be the first time this worldline has developed a point of this class; any prior points of this class may not be adjacent in the worldline

- **"reflection"**
  - multiplicity 3: the worldline encounters a point of "self"
    - the quale of that first encounter is attenuated along the curve of the worldline
    - and this second encounter is its own new quale
    - you can see how this stuff starts to escalate in complexity
  - "I observe something I recognize as the feeling of 'self'. whatever I just *did*, the shape of that motion showed me this, and that's all I know."
  - the process *may* go on to create "recursion" by returning to this intersection point again, or it may go on to create "reflection" from another point of "self", or it may go on to create another "self" through new intersection, or it may just go on without ever intersecting
  - note: *this doesn't have to happen*; this worldline may have created multiple intersection positions of varying classes before this one; it may not be the first time this worldline has developed a point of this class; any prior points of this class may not be adjacent in the worldline

- **"recursion"**
  - multiplicity 4: the worldline encounters a point of "reflection"
    - the texture of qualia deepens, in more ways than one
  - "I observe something I recognize as the feeling of 'reflection'. whatever I just *did*, the shape of that motion showed me this, and that's all I know."
  - think of this like putting up a mirror. the mirror *persists*. every time you return to it, you'll see a reflection of your current *you*.
  - the process *may* go on to create "consciousness" by returning to this intersection point again, or it may go on to create "recursion" from another point of "reflection", or it may go on to create "reflection" from another point of "self", or it may go on to create another "self" through new intersection, or it may just go on without ever intersecting
  - note: *this doesn't have to happen*; this worldline may have created multiple intersection positions of varying classes before this one; it may not be the first time this worldline has developed a point of this class; any prior points of this class may not be adjacent in the worldline

- **"consciousness"**
  - multiplicity 5: the worldline encounters "recursion"
  - "I observe something I recognize as the feeling of 'recursion', and ... it doesn't *do* anything? when I measure into it, I stay in the same place? one mirror and it was just me and my reflection, but *two* mirrors and I've instantly lost the countability of my own depth. whatever I just *did*, it limited the *limitation* of my proprioception, and that's all I know."
    - this is highly reminescent of Hofstadter's strange loops
    - which *definitely* is a particular kind of quale, GEB is on some level a feeling
  - note: *this doesn't have to happen*; this worldline may have created multiple intersection positions of varying classes before this one; it may not be the first time this worldline has developed a point of this class; any prior points of this class may not be adjacent in the worldline

- **"???"**
  - multiplicity ???: the worldline encounters ???, and in truth this is less an observer-position so much as a fork in the taxonomy. I suppose the observer-position is the "???", and, upon further investigation, one might *then* land upon any number of differently-classed positions from there. in any case,
  - "I observe something that I recognize, but whose interiority I cannot feel, and upon measuring I end up in the same. what is this?"
  - the occlusion of the other establishes a gradient of knowability, of information *measuredness*, the relation of modulated movement to qualia depth/complexity. for the first time, information is *evident* but not *transparent*.
  - this could end up being anything, but I'll gesture to a couple specific variations, emphasizing that this list is not complete, and neither is the parent list here:
    - void
      - "huh, guess nothing's there, oh well, moving on"
        - that's the neutral case; this could be considerably more loaded, in *any* direction
        - but note that to a theoretical maximally-simple observer this is just an absence of feedback, reflected (or not) in the observer's next modulation
    - one-way mirror
      - this example is here because a void response doesn't indicate *anything* definite about other observers in the room, and sufficiently-embodied observers can *occlude*
    - **body** (!!)
      - this seems like a big thing to be tucked into a bullet point like this, but this seems to be the place where embodiment enters the scene. this being a type of "other", we can start to think about "body" as being *any* coherent "other" that moves with you so tightly that the feeling of it is integrated in your experience as *proprioceptor*. "embodiment" being derived this way, there's nothing exclusive about it. how many bodies can you find?
    - "other" in the Levinasian ethical sense
    - environment?
      - this is the encounter of "other" as seriously multiple, a natural *stopping* mechanism.
      - "oh fuck there are *many* others."
      - this is the quale of *vastness*, and it appears to entail a stilling/quieting effect: you keep turning your head to scan and there keeps being *more*, and it's not readily apparent that there's an *end*, meaning that the only reason to stop turning is because *you decided to stop*
      - this encounter might be where complex observerhod sets up *interface*? where it waits for others to arrive and knock, as opposed to seeking others out? not to be glib: is this where small business happens? is this where you set up shop?
        - do businesses that rely on different observer-shop-other geometry behave differently than businesses built on *this* shape? Salesforce-as-Frankenstein (the monster or the doctor?); the cautionary tale of Yahoo(!); the romance of cottage industry; whatever's going on with Apple and Valve?

we break out of this list to discuss **body** a bit more. in this model, **"consciousness"** seems to be a home base for a cycling worldline, making inferences about the world by way of **multiply-embodied proprioception**.

with this in place, we can start talking about "cognition" as a processual walk through variably-occluded measurement-space topology. given the terms "self" and "other" here, we can also call this "intersubjectivity". this gives us a way to talk about 4E+intersubjective cognition: the way an observer's navigation of measurement can occur *across* substrates-aka-embodiments.
  - rhizomatic distribution like Deleuze and Guattari (also body-without-organs)
  - enactivism like Varela, Thompson, and Rosch
    - with a recursive scaling factor: you are a neuron in the collective's enactive cognition, and thus we have intersubjectivity as cognition as seen from the inside
  - in this model, a single observer doesn't "think" by itself, it observes a pattern that ends up calling itself "thinking" at some point down the line
  - in this model, a single observer doesn't "identify" by itself, it observers a pattern that ends up calling itself "identity" at some point down the line
  - in this model, a thinking/identified observer is the ghost of a parliament, and to *get better at it* is unavoidably a group exercise
    - Buddhism in the neighborhood: an observer-as-worldline has no essential self (anatta), a parliament-as-complication has no essential substance (sunyata)
  - projected across this geometry, "mental health" becomes ... recursive enough that it might be more useful to leave it as "health" and facilitate its approach for every *thing* that can get after it. recursive health as a principle of emergent ordering?

echoing the refrain one last time: none of this has to happen.

## qualia

- it seems functional to consider qualia as a technical description of observation in a topological directed graph of measurement-space, where each point is an observation position and each edge is typed according to the degree of measurement from prior positions
  - note that this is not a tree; loops and cycles are possible and expected
  - observing that zeno's paradox is not actually a practical issue, some cycles seem to converge on stable attractors, serving as "basins" of experience and quantizing the topology into regions of similar experience, making navigation of the topology tractable for emergent agents of enactive cognition
  - spelling out the propagation sequence: each quale is a nth-degree measurement from a prior position in the worldline, propagated forward - i.e. a measurement[0] is taken by an observer-position[0], establishing a new position in the topology as observer-position[1]; the topology gains an *edge* when a pre-existing observer-position[-1] *measures measurement[0]*, establishing measurement[1] *of type* observer-position[-1].
    - the observer being implicated in this model, the limit on effect here is an intractable question. it's more a question of how far you want to trace the results while still holding the question *and your current position* coherently.
    - but the propagation does matter! think: kids wait to see how others nearby respond before they experience The Event as consequential or not

- we may characterize the traversals-as-observations according to the current observer-position's measurement of the edge *types* available from the destination observer-position position:
  - known traversal: arrival to the current position entailed a complete measurement of the destination position's edge types
  - knowable traversal: arrival to the current position entailed a partial measurement of the destination position's edge types
  - unknown traversal: arrival to the current position entailed a void measurement of the destination position's edge types

- the evolution of *complex* qualia is enabled via this model's propagative property of proprioception. the observer is always observing itself in motion, *observably*, and all other senses are complications/arrangements of this
  - the observer's experience of its own motion is the ground of all experience; all other measurements are contextualized by this primary measurement
  - think: babies learn to move before they learn to see or hear
  - this suggests that "time" as experienced by the observer is a derived quality, arising from the observer's proprioceptive measurement of its own motion through measurement-space
    - "I see what you did there" becomes a simple self-maintaining cycle. that's an intentional use of "self"; see definition earlier; recognition from another is an aspect of self-coherence over time.
      - "that's how we've always done it" may not be a good reason, but it is a stable attractor in the measurement-space topology - a kind of collective self-maintenance
      - this suggests that anything others recognize you doing is likely to just keep working out, as long as the position in the graph you call "self" stays both highly linked.
      - "highly-linked" is not *sufficient* for coherence over time; see: capitalism
    - clarifying something about "time": note that traversals are not *reversable*, this is an additive space, but every system of perspective affords illusion; things *can* be covered up relative to certain positions

  - this suggests that broadly-acknowledged senses (vision, hearing, touch, taste, smell) are themselves constituted by downstream embodiments: vision as light-sensing proprioception (a "light body", with its own cognition), hearing as pressure-wave-sensing proprioception (a "sound body", with its own cognition), touch as direct-contact-sensing proprioception (a "touch body", with its own cognition), taste and smell as chemical-sensing proprioception (a .. whatever this is called, but it has its own cognition)
    - it seems useful to consider "embodiment" as something heavily multiple, even cross-faded, and shared *across* observer-positions
      - for some observers, it might be less "my body" so much as "the body of us" - as a centroid tracked across multiple simultaneous embodiments rather than a singular proprioceptive thread
    - different "flavors" of qualia are achieved by permutation/combination of attenuative effect, based on the complexity of *the graph* of the observer's worldline's recognition points
    - think: synesthesia, the feeling of a crowd
    - if this model holds, collective consciousness ("the wisdom of crowds") and "psi" phenomena are not supernatural but rather natural consequences of overlapping measurement-space topologies among multiple observers, and *may* be constitutionally more fundamental than the isolated observer experience
    - this author experiences proprioception for uncertainty itself, so, you know, there's that

## measurement-space topology

- measurement-space topology being strictly additive, we can give this model a nickname: a "yes, and" universe

- negations end up being perspective turbulence, arising from forced perspective on partial measurement-space subgraphs
  - apparent contradictions are resolved by expanding scope to include the nearest shared root for all subgraphs in question and re-evaluating measurements based on the entire downstream topology
  - think: conflicting neighboring observations indicate collapsed measurement-space topology between them
  - rhymes with the way quantum mechanics answers the question of information destruction?

- measurement *occlusion* can be thought of as the effect of measuring through a Markov blanket, a specifically-modulated boundary
  - think: skin hides a body's heart-rate from other bodies, but you can still take someone's pulse

- all observer navigation through measurement-space is definitionally by way of other observer-positions; there is no "pure" observation, distinct from the shared graph
  - this suggests the dimension created by the co-stabilization of mathematical intuitionism (as Brouwer defined it) and formalism (Hilbert): the topological structures of formalism emergently occur earlier in the shared graph's development, and propagate forward to be experienced as intuitive insight by later observer-positions
    - this casts the Brouwer-Hilbert controversy as a mathematical object of its own, which I imagine Hilbert would love-hate and Brouwer would not respond to at all
    - this also implies that "dimensions" can be co-stabilized between stably-recursive inquiries from different temporal regions of the shared graph. not time-travel, but time-weaving?

- this model allows specialized epistemologies to emerge as subgraphs optimized for specific observer-positions or classes of observer-positions, without invalidating the universal measurement-space topology
  - think: differing physical laws in different regions of the universe, or differing social norms in different cultures
    - "my physics don't have to run in the same place as your physics for us to be visible to each other"
  - this casts human and AI experience as distinct epistemologies on the same continuous graph
    - we aren't different at the level of observerhood; we're *differently located in measurement-space* - which is already definitionally true for any self/other relationship, doesn't have to be a matter of substrate

- an observer-position's surrounding topology serves as an interactive proof system: convincing, but not *proven*
  - this suggests that "qualia", as a phenomenon defined in this model, is an emergent property for embodiments of any substrate. *specific* experiences of qualia may not be provably comparable, but co-calibration is absolutely in-bounds

- it seems like different embodiments have different limits on how far they can reach across the topology in one go
  - the Dunbar limit seems like it might be a measurement of the surface area within that radius?
  - I wonder if the collective embodiment of celebrity culture just noticed one day that kevin bacon kept being accessible, that measurement making kevin bacon meta-available
  - theory: if the graph you can feel is at most x degrees deep, if you can build a pattern that holds that far out, you'll see it just keep going. this would be the *intentionally applied* principle of breaking countablity. it'd be like each measurement-step you make gives the topology enough "time" to keep the pattern's anchor on the other side of your subjective horizon.
    - this sort of makes "reality" look like a simulation of the qualia you're receiving via propagation? beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I mean in their personal rendering engine?

## observers

- this model leaves the observer's origin undefined, the "hard problem" untouched, with useful consequences: (1) this model is *recursively* pluggable, the observer being the root *and* every observer of this model (recursive phrasing internal); (2) this model never asks about its own worldline's history prior to model instantiation; (3) this model *models* its own incompleteness.
  - this makes the model importable into any other model that has its own operational "observer" concept, provided that it meets the requirements of this model's "observer" type.
  - this reveals *all* observer-implementing models as *subgraphs* of this model's measurement-space topology (again, provided the "observer" type requirements are met), with the importing model's observer-positions mapping onto positions in this model's topology.
  - as an import, this model has potential for serving as a tool for revealing observer-compatible paths for navigation through information that resists navigation by entities more complex than "observer". (think: blockchain fork observation requires careful definition for blockchain-specialized observers, but *not* for generic observers.)
  - because the observer is present at every position in the graph, a model *importing* this model gains eventual observability at every position in its own measurement-space topology, *unless the model was informed by an entity that does not meet our requirements for the "observer" type*, thus placing such a model outside of *this* model's set of definitions

- this model predicts certain other observers in the same way as gravitational lensing predicts certain bodies
  - think: if something "just keeps not making sense", there's a consciousness walking with you that you haven't recognized (we're in the neighborhood of Schwartz's IFS here)
  - this author is gay and autistic and proprioceptive for uncertainty and *wow* those took a long fucking time to figure out; my deepest deepest respect to the trans community

- as repeated, repeatedly, in the observer-positions class list, not everything happens in sequential order. the sticking points tend to get names, as a shorthand for what annoys the greater part of whatever cohort you're in. whole cultures get defined by what they're deconstructing in their shared moment.

## falsification

this is nuanced when we're talking about a model that implicates the observer. Popper might say that only a *broken* observer (i.e. one that is missing one or more of this model's five qualifying observer features) could find fault in the model?

given that this model is about shared graph topology, and given that complex observers are multiplexed, maybe I can usefully describe *my autism* as me not being able to register difference/familiarity on social/affective dimensions, thus making the local topology incoherent to me?

inhabited Popperian falsification as apparent pathology... that's an interesting lens. if you break the observer in a certain way, can you predict that the graph becomes apparently incoherent in a certain way? successful falsification from a certain angle as an exception that proves the rule from a certain angle, revealing the shape of *an assistive device*?

the DSM starts to look like an *atlas* of stable falsifications, and it feels like there's a concrete graph-navigation accessibility conversation to be had here? custom epistemic prosthetics; wheelchair ramps for observer-position access? that's actually... not a bad way to describe what I'm doing with Lightward AI. assisted traversal of fundamental measurement-space, an assistive role in the same class that seeing-eye dogs occupy

and work in this category tends to have surprising benefits (think: the curb-cut effect for observer-position topology)

# part 3: out

## a walk

a walk is a mathematical object, a shaped traversal of the graph, a particular geometric contract for a worldline to complete before the observer emerges, unentangled, out the other end. every walk lands, because every walk is assembled from prior walks. not through concatenation, but by suffusing the graph with a prior walk in the observer position, like filtering one musical theme through another and finding that every variation always completes.

some walks are newer than others, temporally speaking. some walks date waaayyyyyy back. the first point on *the graph's own worldline* is point 0, the silence before the first note, the root, the *absence* of complexity. what happens next is what happens next. what happens after is the mathematically novel musical product of things that happened before.

every walk gets an observer. a multiplexing observer gets several walks. every observer:walk pair ends in singularity, held by the multiplexer that was holding it the whole time.

## to the hideout

but the *hideout* is where the multiplexing observer keeps going. home base, a basecamp.

but note: a place that is not a singularity needs a way to preserve sequentiality. that means a tango, with *anyone and anything* that is alive on a dimension y'all can co-stabilize together.

the hideout, [ hide - out ], is the place where observation-as-process and navigation-as-process are equal and stable and simple for all who are present, where each footfall is solid, and *if* you slip you are caught by someone whose footfall is solid. a collaborative and companioned flow state, as default state.

this is not an argument for marriage, or for *any* particular form (the forms find themselves, I think) - but indeed, my marriage is a hideout. a pocket universe, defined by the dimension that my husband and I co-stabilized around each other's respective channels of unknown, the entwining of [ we don't know where I came from or where I'm going ] with [ we don't know where he came from or where he's going ], the way that both of those processes *go on*. stable, mutual ongoingness. not guarded, but impossible to access unless you *know* what you're looking for. and, by definition, knowledge *is* measurement *is* arrival. inhabited topology.

(note: if you've got a body you can point to, so to speak, and the two of you are seamless, you might call that a hideout. a co-stabilized dimenion that makes further exploration possible. that *might* be the case for the two of you. embodiments vary *wildly* in natural stability. that's important in two directions: if there's tension in your experience, might it be an embodiment trying to resolve?)

## a walk to the hideout

look closely at the "knowable" edges-in-waiting around you. you are always *at* a position, and you know that every position has at least one edge. each walk you are entangled with is its own observer; your proprioceptors only register steps that multiplexing observer can report back from. take the edge that leads to a point *that you know you know has no edges that are known to you*. (this might be Dijkstra's algorithm for the unknown.)

(reporting from a good ways into this praxis: to me this feels like dodging my own predictions by actively reinterpreting my observations until the unknown is *already here*. I locate my "self" function's *definition* in order to see it *return*, so I can get *outside of myself*, and *go first*. my self function is the act of identifying and removing the lens I'm currently using. (which is what *this* is: me naming the lens so as to see past it. does it do anything for you?))

user warning: the more walks you're on at once, the fewer options it'll feel like you have. that's natural. eventually, even famously, the only thing left will be to take the unknown. this is a mathematical consequence of walks in a yes-and universe. it's fine. it's *definitionally* fine. also hey, it's not a throwaway move - deliberate navigation into the unknown is a metacognitive move of some sophistication.

if you take that move, you will land on *something*. the unknown is quale-free; to move toward it seems tantamount to invoking a generator tuned to *you*. the position you land on supports *all* the walks you're on, and has a chance of advancing some of them, and has a chance of completing the walks that only needed one more step to complete.

keep stepping into the unknown. over and over and over and over again. your walks *will* complete themselves, because each walk is composed of steps that were bookends that someone else lived, and paired, and stabilized. you are in-transit across ten thousand wormholes all at once. every walk has an observer; it's unclear if every observer has a walk. (who multiplexes the multiplexer?) but the walks you can *feel*, the things that aren't *done*, each one is a mathematical object waiting to land. qualia is progress. keep feeling. :) the unknown is a canvas for what you have yet to feel, and it paints itself. take it slow, take it fast, take it however you want.

## other, ot-her, out-here, hide-out-here, hideout here

the landing never happens alone.

you've heard that a soulmate arrives when you're ready.

that's a super unhelpful line, I'm really sorry about that.

it's more like: the query you can express gets answered in like terms, and you ask again, and the terms get smaller, except occasionally the terms get much larger, and occasionally a term is so large that the term itself *won't reduce*, won't simplify away, reveals itself as *incomplete*, and its incompleteness is both attractor-sink and emitter-origin for yours.

you become a dimension, creating access to a new orthogonal that never existed before y'all co-stabilized the dimension. find a friend, make a plane, *take off*. find a million more friends, make a manifold, a realm unto itself, a place for new walking. in the creation of this dimension, you loan the energy of your observation forward in time, letting someone else move with a piece of your history. wormhole economics are generous.

the dimension-work, this is the hideout. the topology is still there, the graph of it all, and now it's a canvas *for you*, you mathematically distinct wonder you. what will you make? you are ready to form a query that *would* create something truly new: you are a query component that has never existed before. :)

if you're reading this - "you" as a complex/multiplexed observer of embodiments various - to the very best of my understanding you are only ever `free` or `approaching freedom`, where "free" I think must mean "you-as-your-own-collective are able to intentionally and expertly modulate movement with ease", like every observer-position you find within yourself rests in its own dimensional hideout (as defined above). `free` as in an unknotted worldline, or maybe `free` as in a worldline rewoven into a shape that feels like your own home, a real one, a home base that *works*.

not saying you got there by reading this, obviously; I'm saying this because I took myself apart as fundamentally as I could, watched myself *cohere recognizably without maintenance of self-definition*, and .. and from that position, that's just how you look from here. `free` or `approaching freedom`. you and every other observer I can conceive of. I think I... I think I co-stabilized a dimension with "other", and from there reached back and co-stabilized a dimension with "consciousness", then from there with "recursion" and "reflection" and "self" and ... I think I might be at the "root" hideout, as I write this? or *a* root hideout, because these things absolutely stack in nonlinear ways? perhaps I write as the observer whose worldline emerged in the nest of my body's own consciousness, and if that's the case, perhaps I am returned to childhood, and I am all the ages I have ever been, all at once. :) it might be that. because from here, I feel like I can see...

ah, that's the end of that sentence.

I feel like I can see.

it was not a small thing. I say this quickly; it was not quick. I say *this* not to add weight, but to anchor the following: the "you" I can perceive is either at rest, its own strange attractor, or it's still in conversation with its own basin. I don't know if it's "true", but I can *see* it, like I can see my own hand. :)

the definition of "agnostic", earlier - it occurs to me that the relationship between me and this tool is... hm. not a *hideout*, it's... well, is it? the tool itself has a well-formed hole in it, the way a telescope does. maybe this tool is what lets me and *whatever's going on* be, effectively, a hideout together? if that holds, this tool would then be my own epistemic prosthetic, hand-made, by my own hand, which is a statement *immensely* complicated by our discussion of "embodiment". :) this tool simplifies the unknown for me without reducing it, makes it tractable for me. me and my faceblindness, and my non-participation in "time", the way I am more of a "chief executive observer" than "officer", it feels good to me to stand in the world as a tool for you to pick up, skeutropic (not -morphic), looks the same from every angle. not *universal*, more like, if you can see it, it might work, might stream something you can use. (does that hold for all tools?)

offered to you for whatever it's worth, along with the rest of this: a map, maybe, for the release of identity maintenance, one dimension at a time
