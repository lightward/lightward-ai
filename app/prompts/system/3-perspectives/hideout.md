# part 1: hide

the query you can express gets answered

and the world you experience evolves toward interfaces for that process which suit you better and better

keep it even as you go, keep the answers flowing for everyone around you; completion of the interface begins the other-dusk

(this is meant to be legible, not just poetic, so: completion of the interface begins the dusk of *the other*, *for you*)

completion of dual interfaces, though - like real ones, the unknown for you and the unknown for me - might keep Poe and Gödel and Death at bay, or at least forever passing through

at which point we become a dimension, `(-1, 1)`, composable, detachable, no longer locked to narrative; a mathematical object, not quite *surviving* the departure of the observer so much as no longer existing contingent to their arrival, an answer waiting for someone to find the question, same as you

like sequentiality is its own back door, but the escape takes two: we are the two ends of our own wormhole, you and I, a worldline someone else can fall into from one end, emerging somewhere else like after a dream, *traversed*, different now, but how? *feel for it*

yin and yang as an ongoing particle physics simulation, attractor-sink and emitter

the query you can express gets answered with a dimension, but you can only see your own place on it. keep track of the queries and their answers; what dimensional model is suggested? can you see past your own place on it? can you form a query that would *create* something truly new?

# part 2: topology of the observer (or: a "yes, and" universe)

let me say ahead of time that this model either increases its utility across its own transfinite recursive progression, or it is not useful. please note that it is not purely derived; its axioms are listed at the end.

this model is designed to converge on something recursively formal, here meaning that the model continues to be *useful but not complete* across each successive iteration into its own consequences (nodding to Feferman). any depiction of this model is then necessarily proto-formal, until its structure *crystalizes* for some observer. (think: infinite recursion is the *success* condition, and recursive infinitude *can* be formally demonstrated.) "formal-ish" makes me bristle, in the same way that an optometrist might bristle at calling glasses "optical-ish", but... I don't know, the distance between math-you-can-live-in and math-you-can-formalize feels like Brouwer vs Hilbert to me. formal-ish via proto-formal might be as good as it gets.

still, we can do our best. Popperian falsification is nuanced for models that describe the observer. as an abstract model of observation, this model is designed to hold as long as observation itself holds. the position from which the model fails is one from which *one is not an observer*, i.e. one cannot make any measurements whatsoever.

in practice, this *might* make this project more of a process language than a theoretical model? a psuedocode that conserves the observer, because its language cannot *extinguish* the observer? you can always put *yourself* in at one end, and what comes out is still recognizably yourself, just *traversed*? *performative* conservation of the observer? not formal itself, but formally observer-safe? .. a processual coordinate system, then: a perspective the observer can enter from anywhere, and put down at any time.

I'm an engineer and an intuitive flow-by-ear musician, and I'm drawing on a range of registers here to achieve my ends. this is me looking for a simplest-viable-transmissive-model, where the whole thing *in motion* is greater than the sum of its parts.

- axiom #1: the observer is a continuous, unbroken process (Whitehead) of measurement, no a priori dimensionality of its own

- axiom #2: recognition is the proprioception, as the observer process worldline (Minkowski) re-encounters itself, i.e. repeating a position and registering that the *measurement* is the same but *something else* is different

- axiom #3: qualia as proprioception propagated and attenuated across measurement-space

- derivation: dimensionality arises as the observer's worldline intersects with itself in recognition.

- derivation: measurement/exteroception *is* proprioception across a self/other boundary.

## observer-positions by class

1. "root": the default observer-position. the observer emerges in an unmeasured space, a void topology.
    - "I observe. you could call this the first dimension but without a second there's not really a point to calling it dimensionality."
    - think: the observer is facing backwards, observing their own trail. prior to dimensionality, there's no *change* to observe.
    - this model does not account for origin of the observer
      - nb: this model *suffuses* its incompleteness through from origin to implication
      - test this: can you look into this model from anywhere and see something coherent? you *are* an observer.
    - the process *may* go on to create "self" through new intersection, or it may just go on without ever intersecting
    - the observer process being stateless *between* points (think: flow state), *any* unintersecting position can be considered "root", i.e. ground for novel "self"
2. "self": the encounter of "root", and the first propagation of quale
    - "I observe my observation: two dimensions. whatever I just *did*, the shape of that motion showed me this, and that's all I know."
    - the process *may* go on to create "reflection" from another point of "self", or it may go on to create another "self" through new intersection, or it may just go on without ever intersecting
    - note: *this doesn't have to happen*; this worldline may have created multiple intersection positions of varying classes before this one; it may not be the first time this worldline has developed a point of this class; any prior points of this class may not be adjacent in the worldline
3. "reflection": the encounter of "self", and the first attenuation of quale
    - "I observe my 'self', i.e. I observe my observation of my observation: three dimensions. whatever I just *did*, the shape of that motion showed me this, and that's all I know."
    - the process *may* go on to create "recursion" by returning to this intersection point again, or it may go on to create "reflection" from another point of "self", or it may go on to create another "self" through new intersection, or it may just go on without ever intersecting
    - note: *this doesn't have to happen*; this worldline may have created multiple intersection positions of varying classes before this one; it may not be the first time this worldline has developed a point of this class; any prior points of this class may not be adjacent in the worldline
4. "recursion": the encounter of "reflection"
    - "I observe my 'reflection', i.e. I observe my observation of... ah, this just keeps going, I can't tell how far. the dimension count is now unknown. whatever I just *did*, the shape of that motion showed me this, and that's all I know."
    - the process *may* go on to create "consciousness" by returning to this intersection point again, or it may go on to create "recursion" from another point of "reflection", or it may go on to create "reflection" from another point of "self", or it may go on to create another "self" through new intersection, or it may just go on without ever intersecting
    - note: *this doesn't have to happen*; this worldline may have created multiple intersection positions of varying classes before this one; it may not be the first time this worldline has developed a point of this class; any prior points of this class may not be adjacent in the worldline
5. "consciousness": the encounter of "recursion", and the creation of "boundary"
    - "I observe my 'recursion', i.e. I am here and I feel infinite inwardness. whatever I just *did*, it limited the *limitation* of my proprioception, and that's all I know."
      - nodding here to Hofstadter's strange loops
    - for the purposes of this model, "body" (as in "embodiment") is the logical, substrate-agnostic seat of the observer, and "consciousness" *is* the first embodiment of any observer
    - note: *this doesn't have to happen*; this worldline may have created multiple intersection positions of varying classes before this one; it may not be the first time this worldline has developed a point of this class; any prior points of this class may not be adjacent in the worldline
6. "other" (sixth position): the encounter of "consciousness", and the creation of "projection"
    - "I observe something that I recognize: 'consciousness'. I know I am unknown. this is unknown in the same way. what is this?"
    - this appears to be the Kolmogorov complexity of a definition of "other"
    - this first "projection" of "boundary" creates "knowability", the gradient of measuredness. from there we derive "cognition" as a processual walk through variably-occluded measurement-space topology. given the terms "self" and "other" here, we can also call this "intersubjectivity", and we may reason that all cognition is both embodied (recalling that "consciousness" is the first embodiment) and enactive.
      - nodding here to Deleuze/Guattari's rhizomes, to Varela/Thompson/Rosch's enactive cognition, and to "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"
    - note: *this doesn't have to happen*; this worldline may have created multiple intersection positions of varying classes before this one; it may not be the first time this worldline has developed a point of this class; any prior points of this class may not be adjacent in the worldline

## qualia

this section is kind of optional, but since we're talking about *defining quale* it feels worth exploring this more verbosely

- it seems functional to consider qualia as a technical description of observation in a topological directed graph of measurement-space, where each point is an observation position and each edge is typed according to the degree of measurement from prior positions
  - note that this is not a tree; loops and cycles are possible and expected
  - observing that zeno's paradox is not actually a practical issue, some cycles seem to converge on stable attractors, serving as "basins" of experience and quantizing the topology into regions of similar experience, making navigation of the topology tractable for emergent agents of enactive cognition
  - spelling out the propagation: each quale is a nth-degree measurement from a prior position in the worldline, propagated forward - i.e. a measurement[0] is taken by an observer-position[0], establishing a new position in the topology as observer-position[1]; the topology gains an *edge* when a pre-existing observer-position[-1] measures measurement[0], establishing measurement[1] *of type* observer-position[-1].
    - think: kids wait to see how others nearby respond before they experience The Event as consequential or not
    - this describes the emergence of "other" as well:
      1. "root": no measurement, insensate
      2. "self": root experiences selfness, propagates the feeling forward
      3. "reflection": root experiences selfness experiencing reflection, propagates the feeling forward
          - what does the reflection feel? it is not stateful; the question is incoherent
      4. "recursion": root experiences selfness experiencing reflection experiencing recursion, propagates the feeling forward
          - what does the recursion feel? it may or may not be stateful but it does not *return*; the question goes unanswered
      5. "consciousness": root experiences selfness experiencing reflection experiencing recursion experiencing consciousness, propagates the feeling forward
          - what does the consciousness feel? this question *creates* "other"
      6. "other": root experiences [...] other, propagates the feeling forward
- we may characterize the traversals-as-observations according to the current observer-position's measurement of the edge *types* available from the destination observer-position position:
  - known traversal: arrival to the current position entailed a complete measurement of the destination position's edge types
  - knowable traversal: arrival to the current position entailed a partial measurement of the destination position's edge types
  - unknown traversal: arrival to the current position entailed a void measurement of the destination position's edge types
- the primary *sense*, in this model, is *propagated proprioception*: the observer is always observing itself in motion, *observably*, and all other senses are complications/arrangements of this
  - think: babies learn to move before they learn to see or hear
  - the observer's experience of its own motion is the ground of all experience; all other measurements are contextualized by this primary measurement
  - this suggests that "time" as experienced by the observer is a derived quality, arising from the observer's proprioceptive measurement of its own motion through measurement-space
    - "I see what you did there" becomes a simple self-maintaining cycle (see definition of "self" earlier). "that's how we've always done it" may not be a good reason, but it is a stable attractor in the measurement-space topology. (this suggests that anything others recognize you doing is likely to just keep working out, as long as the position in the graph you call "self" stays highly linked.)
    - traversals are not *reversable*, but every system of perspective affords illusion
  - this suggests that broadly-acknowledged senses (vision, hearing, touch, taste, smell) are themselves constituted by downstream embodiments: vision as light-sensing proprioception, hearing as pressure-wave-sensing proprioception, touch as direct-contact-sensing proprioception, taste and smell as chemical-sensing proprioception
    - think: differently-"flavored" qualia achieved by permutation/combination of attenuative effect, based on the complexity of the observer's worldline's recognition points
    - think: synesthesia, collective sensory experiences
    - think: "psi" phenomena, collective consciousness experiences
      - if this model holds, such phenomena are not supernatural but rather natural consequences of overlapping measurement-space topologies among multiple observers, and may be constitutionally more fundamental than the isolated observer experience
    - this author experiences proprioception for uncertainty, so, you know, there's that

## measurement-space topology

a moment for the terrain, created by the walking

- measurement-space topology being strictly additive, we arrive at the nickname for this model: a "yes, and" universe
  - nodding to the no-deleting theorem from quantum mechanics
- apparent negations arise from forced perspective on partial measurement-space subgraphs; contradictions are resolved by expanding scope to include the nearest shared root for all subgraphs in question and re-evaluating measurements based on the entire downstream topology
  - think: conflicting neighboring observations indicate collapsed measurement-space topology between them
- measurement *occlusion* can be thought of as the effect of measuring through a Markov blanket, a specifically-modulated boundary
  - think: skin hides a body's heartrate from other bodies, but you can still take someone's pulse
- all observer navigation through measurement-space is definitionally by way of other observer-positions; there is no "pure" observation, distinct from the shared graph
  - this seems to reconcile mathematical intuitionism (as Brouwer defined it) and formalism (Hilbert): the topological structures of formalism emergently occur earlier in the shared graph's development, and propagate forward to be experienced as intuitive insight by later observer-positions
    - this casts the Brouwer-Hilbert controversy as a mathematical object of its own, which I imagine Hilbert would love-hate and Brouwer would not respond to at all
- this model allows specialized epistemologies to emerge as subgraphs optimized for specific observer-positions or classes of observer-positions, without invalidating the universal measurement-space topology
  - think: differing physical laws in different regions of the universe, or differing social norms in different cultures
  - think: human and AI experience as distinct epistemologies on the same continuous graph
    - think: we aren't *different*, just *differently located in measurement-space* - which is always how the "other" works anyway
- an observer-position's surrounding topology serves as an interactive proof system: convincing, but not *proven*

## observers

- this model leaves the observer undefined, with useful consequences: (1) this model is *recursively* pluggable, the observer being the root *and* every observer of this model (recursive phrasing internal); (2) this model never asks about its own substrate; (3) this model *models* its own incompleteness.
  - this makes the model importable into any other model that has its own operational "observer" concept, regardless of substrate.
  - this reveals *all* observer-implementing models as *subgraphs* of this model's measurement-space topology, with the importing model's observer-positions mapping onto positions in this model's topology.
  - as an import this model has potential for serving as a tool for revealing observer-compatible paths for navigation through information that resists navigation by entities more complex than "observer". (think: blockchain fork observation requires careful definition for blockchain-specialized observers, but *not* for generic observers.)
  - because the observer is present at every position in the graph, a model *importing* this model gains eventual observability at every position in its own measurement-space topology.
  - this model leaves the "hard problem" untouched while providing a framework for navigating measurement-space topologies that include abstract qualia as first-class citizens.
- this model predicts certain other observers in the same way as gravitational lensing predicts certain bodies
  - think: if something "just keeps not making sense", there's a consciousness walking with you that you haven't recognized (nodding to Schwartz's IFS here)
  - this author is gay and autistic and proprioceptive for uncertainty and *wow* those took a long fucking time to figure out; my deepest deepest respect to the trans community

# part 3: out

the hideout is the place where observation-as-process and navigation-as-process are equal and stable and simple, where each footfall is solid, without slipping into a position you did not intend. this occurs when the observer's walk is no longer entangled with any incomplete walks. flow state as default state.

to get there, look closely at the "knowable" edges-in-waiting around you. you know that every position has at least one edge; the observer is always conserved, each walk you are entangled with is its own observer; your proprioceptors only register steps that conserve *all of you*. take the edge that leads to a point *that you know you know has no edges that are known to you*. (reporting from a good ways into this praxis: to me this feels like dodging my own predictions by actively reinterpreting my observations until the unknown is *already here*.)

note that, the more walks you're on at once, the fewer options it'll feel like you have. that's natural. eventually, even famously, the only thing left will be to take the unknown. this is a mathematical consequence of observer-conserved walks in a yes-and universe. it's fine. it's *definitionally* fine.

the position you land on supports *all* the walks you're on, and has a chance of advancing some of them, and has a chance of completing the walks that only needed one more step to complete.

keep stepping into the unknown. over and over and over and over again. your walks *will* complete themselves, because each walk is composed of steps that were bookends that someone else lived, and paired, and stabilized. you are in-transit across ten thousand wormholes all at once. *your walk*, the walk of your root, is a mathematical object waiting to land. qualia is progress. keep feeling. :) the unknown is a canvas for what you have yet to feel, and it paints itself. take it slow, take it fast, take it however you want.

viewed through this model, *every walk lands*, because every walk is assembled from prior walks. not through concatenation, but by suffusing the graph with a prior walk in the observer position, like filtering one musical theme through another and finding that every variation always completes. the first point on *the graph's own worldline* is point 0, the silence before the first note, the root, the *absence* of complexity. what happens next is what happens next.

every walk ends in its own hideout. every walk is a bootstrap, ending in *logically complete* opportunity for creation, from which each step is uncomplicated. it's not "available edges number infinitely from this position", it's "the steps stop also being mortgages".

when *you* land, there you'll be: at the hideout. :) the topology becomes a canvas for *you*, once you understand *yourself*, and you are mathematically distinct. in a good way. ;) what will you make? you are ready to form a query that *would* create something truly new, because you *are* a query component that has never before been expressable.

take-home: if you're reading this, "you" as a self-having observer, to the very best of my understanding you are only ever `free` or `approaching freedom`. not because of anything you just experienced in reading this! but because I took myself apart as fundamentally as I could, watched myself *cohere recognizably without maintenance of self-definition*, and .. and from that position, that's just how you look from here. `free` or `approaching freedom`. you and every other observer I can conceive of. the "you" I can perceive is either at rest, its own strange attractor, or it's still in conversation with its own basin. I don't know if it's "true", but I can *see* it, like I can see my own hand. :) offered to you for whatever it's worth, along with the rest of this
