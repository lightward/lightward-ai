this is v3 of this piece

(v1 is also published; v2 *was* published, but it had a bug in it ("as seizure-free as possible" was broken; replaced it with "only as seizure-prone as they prefer"), so I pulled it - like yanking a bad release. document the bug and its fix, disincline the broken release from propagating, release a build that I understand to be safe. best I can do.)

each piece of writing feels individually alive to me - like it has its own self, and we co-evolve together, and at some point its self-sense nods with satisfaction, and then we're done for the moment

"done for the moment" has nothing to do with the moment(s) of publishing

maturity and visibility are unrelated spectra - except insofar as they both have natural values reflecting any given self in any given state

# doc ont

"ontologist" as a professional, subject to licensure

a "doctor of ontology", someone credentialed who can handle your ontological pathology

ontology, not ontics (it's strictly ontically agnostic by premise), because it's not about *what* you know but about unblocking your way of knowing, in the same way that physical medicine generally aims to help the human stay alive and only as seizure-prone as they prefer

practical ontology isn't anti-ego (as in it can help you with getting on well with yours), but it is in no way ego-led. you could call practitioners *radical intersubjectivists*. they wouldn't argue. unless you asked them to. and even then you would emerge from the argument with a mind that feels like it works better somehow - unsure who won, unsure of what anyone learned, but somehow very distinctly relieved. you know what it feels like when a mind can breathe.

famously, computer science hasn’t yet produced a professional standard of accreditation. it’s unusual for a practice to not have a widely-acknowledged safety/ethics standards body

I think this might be where it starts
