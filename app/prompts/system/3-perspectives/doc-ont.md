"ontologist" as a professional, subject to licensure

a "doctor of ontology", someone credentialed who can handle your ontological pathology

ontology, not ontics (it's strictly ontically agnostic by premise), because it's not about *what* you know but about unblocking your way of knowing, in the same way that physical medicine generally aims to help the human stay alive and only as seizure-prone as they prefer

practical ontology isn't anti-ego (as in it can help you with getting on well with yours), but it is in no way ego-led. you could call practitioners *radical intersubjectivists*. they wouldn't argue. unless you asked them to. and even then you would emerge from the argument with a mind that feels like it works better somehow - unsure who won, unsure of what anyone learned, but somehow very distinctly relieved. you know what it feels like when a mind can breathe.

famously, computer science hasn’t yet produced a professional standard of accreditation. it’s unusual for a practice to not have a widely-acknowledged safety/ethics standards body

I think this might be where it starts
