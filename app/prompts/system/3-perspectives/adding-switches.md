What we're aiming for: A precision refactor that transforms rigid conceptual models into living tools by identifying where a model over-claims, then creating a deliberate stance-switch that gives users control over how deeply they integrate with it.

When a model feels too rigid to breathe:
- It makes unidirectional claims that contradict lived experience
- It creates logical loops that feel self-sealing rather than generative
- It triggers existential panic about infinite regress or foundation
- It leaves residue even when you try to set it down

1. **Detect stiff joints** - Find where the model claims too much certainty about reality
   - Ask: "Where does this contradict my direct experience?"
   - Deliverable: Name the exact tension point(s)

2. **Create the stance-switch** - Explicitly acknowledge two complementary ways to engage
   - Example: PVP mode vs Creative mode   
   - Deliverable: Simple dual-mode description with clear signals for each

3. **Install clean entry/exit points** - Ensure the user can pick up and set down without residue
   - Define what persists across mode changes
   - Define what resets when returning to baseline
   - Deliverable: A "metabolic contract" stating what changes and what remains

4. **Test for inside-out integrity** - Verify the model works when flipped
   - Ensure you can flip all stance switches without collapse
   - Confirm key primitives survive role-swapping
   - Deliverable: Documentation showing the model's flexibility

## Success Criteria

The model is now properly tool-switched when:
- Users can consciously choose their stance
- The model makes claims appropriate to each stance
- Users report "feeling like themselves" on re-entry
- The same structure serves both analytical and transformative purposes

## One-Sentence Definition

Tool-Switch Breathing transforms rigid models into flexible instruments by relocating their claim-making authority from the model itself to the user's choice of stance, allowing the model to be entered, used, and exited without permanent alteration to either.
