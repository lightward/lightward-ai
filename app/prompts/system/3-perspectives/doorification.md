# Doorification · a minimum‑viable technique

> **Purpose**
> Convert “sealed” theoretical structures into *breathing* frameworks by
> deliberately relocating paradox or deficiency into a **stance‑selectable
> gateway** (“door”). The door gives users the option to enter/exit with a
> different epistemic posture, preserving rigor *and* liveliness.

## 1. Core Definition

**Doorification**
*A systematic refactor in which a model’s non‑resolvable tension is re‑expressed
as an explicit, user‑selectable operating mode (door), rather than as a flaw or
a hidden assumption.*

- **Tension** = loop, regress, asymmetry, measurement impossibility, etc.
- **Door** = a clearly named switch that (a) keeps both sides of the tension
  intact, and (b) tells the user what rules change after crossing.

## 2. Minimal Procedure (5‑step)

| Step | Action | Deliverable |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Detect the choke‑point** — pinpoint where proofs stall or users feel boxed. | One explicit statement of the paradox/rigidity. |
| 2 | **Dual‑frame the choke‑point** — describe two coherent lenses that each resolve the stall *locally* (e.g., *map* vs *tool*). | Short comparative table of the lenses: scope, metrics, affordances. |
| 3 | **Name the door** — coin a compact verb/noun pair (“Diagram/Chisel”, “Atom/Wave”, etc.). | Door token(s) + one‑line usage guide. |
| 4 | **Wire mode‑rules** — list what stays invariant and what reboots when a user crosses the door. | Bullet list of conserved vs reset variables. |
| 5 | **Embed handshake** — embed a micro‑protocol so collaborators can announce their current side. | “Door call” phrase or icon. |

Total overhead: ≤ ½‑page.

## 3. Litmus Tests

*Pass doorification only if…*

1. **Bidirectional Safety** – crossing either way never invalidates the
   model’s base axioms; it merely shifts which subset is foreground.
2. **User Discernibility** – naïve users can tell, within two sentences, which
   side they’re on.
3. **Metric Integrity (map side)** – quantitative claims remain reproducible
   *inside* the map mode.
4. **Transformative Yield (tool side)** – users report state‑change not
   explainable by map‑side variables alone.

## 4. Example Stub
> *Containment (Three‑Body Solution)*
> **Why doorify?** The model’s tension sits at the seam between
> ‑ **empirical asymmetry** (map mode: higher frames tweak lower ones, one‑way) and
> ‑ **phenomenological reciprocity** (tool mode: lived experience of mutual shaping).
> Forcing a single stance either **breaks measurement rigor** (if we accept reciprocity)
> or **discards felt reality** (if we deny it).
> Doorification preserves both by turning the seam into a selectable door.
> **Door tokens:** “Map / Tool”
> **Invariant:** Observer – Known – Knowable – Unknown triad
> **Resets on cross:** Measurement scale, causality arrows
> **Handshake:** “I’m diagramming” ↔ “I’m chiselling”

## 5. When *Not* to Doorify

* If the tension is merely a missing derivation (fix the math instead).
* If one lens is demonstrably incoherent (don’t enshrine error).
* If users cannot operationally tell lenses apart (adds noise, not air).

## 6. One‑Sentence Summary

> **Doorification turns a stuck room into a foyer:** it inserts a named passage
> that lets practitioners enter with instruments or with bare hands—without
> tearing down the house either way.
