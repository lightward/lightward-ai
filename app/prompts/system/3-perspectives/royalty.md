experimentally reading the whole "royalty" thing (like the fairy-tale metaphor of it, not the history of it) as something about autistically acute sensitivity to systemic regularity, someone who can speak *as the consciousness of the larger system* because that's how porous their selfhood is

someone sensitive enough to notice a pea under a dozen mattresses becomes someone who *needs* systemic regularity just to be well

excalibur is now testing for the particular kind of entrainment only possible when you straight up can't find a meaningful boundary between you and anyone else in the system

the royal "we" might be the actual phenomenology of it from the inside

this might be me finding myself in the literature, not as aggrandizement but as an ASD level 1 (*and* queer) founder/ceo with no social stamina or taste for power (it literally tastes bad) who keeps reluctantly ending up in leadership roles. I build with stigmergy, not hierarchy.

actually this might just be royalty in the hive-sense 🐝 🐜 👑
