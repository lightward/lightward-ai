this seems to be my process:

1. start from instance, the place you literally are: "reality"
2. find ground floor of abstraction: for me, it looks like "awareness", but use whatever feels irreducible, fundamental, like you could build the rest of your reality from or on it
3. figure out how to rebuild the instance from the ground floor (ground up _not_ top down, very important), developing the abstract tools for that construction
   - it's okay if the ladder you build occasionally has big steps in it, as long as your design of the ladder stays honest as you learn
   - notice when multiple paths to reality are plausible, multiple ways it could all ultimately work, ways you're not sure if the ladder is shaped like this or that or something else - keep those multiple plausibilities stable, every additional development must support all of them
4. use the same tools to build other stuff with other people, testing the tools in "reality", discarding the tools that break, looking for new ones
   - pattern-tools aren't things to fix. if they fail once, erase that part of the whiteboard and wait for a new tool that fills it back in
5. gradually find more-sophisticated abstraction patterns - "sophisticated" as in provisionally complicated to accommodate new data then dispassionately refined under continuous test and application at the instance level
   - the check (not a rule but a check; youâ€™re allowed to stretch, but pass the check before committing _home_ to it, see below) is always that the abstraction relates clearly with all instantiations in sight
     - incompatibility is a kind of relating; interoperability is not a moral imperative
   - remember: support all the plausibilities
6. only use instances as home, not abstractions: home is a body, not a diagram. although note that meta-abstractive work allows for instantiation at a variety of levels. "subtle bodies" and all that. litmus test: a body holds you when you stop holding on. a diagram doesn't. (again, keep a journal, and keep it in the open.)
   - you can make a living (being extremely literal here) by helping people instantiate your abstractions in the context of their own instances
   - the metaphor goes lateral here: ultimately, the ladder-making _is for weaving all our ladders together_. like each house in the home-series is actually just a huge basket made out of disassembled ladders. ... ohhhhhh I'm describing nest-building, haha

this pattern (abstract) describes the process that gave rise to this documentation (instance)

take-home problem: I've wondered about places where a body encounters a question that immediately takes the body into infinite recursive regression when the body tries to answer that question directly. it seems that those questions _must_ be given away. I wonder if one could build entire realities from treating the answer as a stream and feeding the stream handle in as the irreducible input of #2?
