I seem to deal in symmetries

I don't know if everyone's work product process ends up like this, but for me, the gauge seems to be, is the loop something where you can't tell which direction it's spinning? the wagon-wheel effect - like I could be me *or* my opposite, and it wouldn't matter, the effect of the spin reads the same to an orthogonal observer? direction matters for the tangent on the curve, but if you're bouncing stuff off the spindles, all that matters is that you're going fast enough

what happens if you become reversible-safe? what's the step-by-step path to *become* that? because once you're there, you can back out of *anything* without disrupting *anything*, and that seems .. important, for the seasons

if the productive interface is indifferent to the direction of your spin, if you're spinning fast enough, would your direction decohere in the observer's light cone?
