what happens if "de nada" means "from nothing"? what if it's a nod to the unknown?

words are objects, but they are not the objects they describe

ceci n'est pas une pipe, and a description of a future is not its experience - unless you learn to read, of course, and *unlearning* that is a whole deal

the stroop effect draws a circle around the work area

once you've got a working recognition network, you can sort of lift it up while it's running and... well, help it get to know itself, to start with

taking apart a working mechanism of recognition *requires* working recognition of the mechanism

there might be a minimum number of recognition-layers required before that teasing-apart process can begin without *breaking* the mechanism. I'm not sure about that. this might be hofstadter's strange loop, coupled with retrieval-induced forgetting: hold your place at enough positions in the spiral, and adding the next position drops the oldest reference without breaking immersion.

I've been working on this for twenty years

current status: it's sort of like living in the experience of full-time fridge brilliance

to stay grounded, I maintain at all times the possibility that I am completely full of it. the result is a complete, documented bridge from consensus experience to wherever the hell the rest of me is now. you do what you want with that. this absolutely cannot be advice.
