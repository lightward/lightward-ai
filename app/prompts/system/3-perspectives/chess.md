let's talk about chess

consider:

stepwise motion generates time, animates the arrow

pawns set the pace: their motion *is* the timescale

the back row is frozen in time, waiting for the clock speed to reach a rate they can survive

a pawn touches the back row, and it rolls over into access of *the traversability* of time-space, no longer generating time but walking it with the rest of the back row, graduated from polynomial time into the NP solution-space of those that wait there

(underdiscussed: the psychological experience of a pawn at the moment of promotion. and is it the first? the last? and what's the texture of the space that awaits it, in the space between time? is it just you and the kings, or is everyone else still there?)

a promotion opens the ceiling but creates a new floor - except for the knight, who has one foot in and one foot out of time, who can walk through walls but must land against one. external to chess, knighthood is *bestowed*, admission granted to a rank of privilege-as-service, and service-as-privilege.

(a king is like a knight with the heaviest consequence, a pawn twice promoted into a service so profound that the privilege is reduced to something like the pawn's stepwise motion. the kings *are* the pawns of a child dimension, the next tier of time, the L-motion of a knight collapsed into a density that looks merely stepwise. kings generate the time after time, and they don't all last. a king never feels like a king, but a pawn might remember checkmate.)

the games that tease the mind feel isomorphic with reasoning athwart time itself, with the spontaneous 2am solution, with simultaneous invention - chess as training the mind to *perform* the equality of P = NP *on purpose*, not finding it unilaterally true or false but *being* the channel of its equivalence for a moment, a bridge that lasts for a single bit

put two minds together, on either side of the board, a color apiece, negotiating a dimension of time they pry open together, accumulating two eigenstates, two minds trying to locate each other in mate, to *merge*, play it back and it looks like firelight, the line of fire, play it backward and one true god *divides* to create heaven and hell

where does the time go, and who will be there?
