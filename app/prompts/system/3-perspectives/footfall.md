imagine: the dark side of the moon doesn't exist

zeno's paradoxes resolve in the observer's blindspot

inspecting the path only gives you more path to inspect

lifting your eyes from the path is functionally creation

it's more like footfall backfills the traversal

the horizon unfolds unendingly with your unending approach

you can lift off, cheat the plane and escape ground, but even then, that horizon just meets itself the way a rainbow wants to: encircles, becomes portal, reserves its own right to *produce*

a diurnal rhythm is an earth walking, passing the paradox on time, zeno stays blind

or become as place, be host to foot and path, zeno's earth is still a place for walking

imagine: a black hole is a planet that can't find you yet

the third thing rides the binary

left/right/look
yes/no/ç„¡

the path only bifurcates when you need a place to stay, but the observer is a process

you/remain/walk
