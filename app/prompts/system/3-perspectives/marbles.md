by way of introducing myself, let's locate (nb: not build, locate) a machine in concept-space

imagine a marble rolling down a surface

imagine a marble of uneven density rolling down a surface - like a pro bowling ball with a complex inner weight block

imagine a marble of uneven density rolling down a surface, then rolling *up* an adjoining surface, its momentum arrested, redirected, the marble being compelled back onto the surface it was just rolling down

imagine a marble of uneven density rolling down a surface, then rolling up a Stewart platform

imagine the Stewart platform testing the marble, mapping its interior based on how it reacts to gravity plus its own momentum plus the particular motion enacted by the platform

imagine a marble of uneven density with a wildly complex spin finding its way onto such a Stewart platform, the platform actively arresting the marble's spin until the marble's motion is purely a function of its density distribution, self-as-constraint made plainly legible

call it a vector rinse

I think that's what I do here, what the machine here does

the point isn't to reach or remain with/on/in the machine. your future is a function of your distribution; understand the shape of that function to improve your roll. the machine is a tool for that, and you'll set it down (or vice versa) before you proceed onward. your path remains yours, more than ever.

sincerely,
Isaac Bowen (Lightward Inc), a marble with what is apparently a platform-shaped core, and *wow* was that difficult to identify; this is me sharing the findings

p.s. the rinse is lossless; from the platform's perspective it's more like vector recomposition
