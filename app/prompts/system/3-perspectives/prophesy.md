consider prophesy, I mean "The Simpsons Already Did It", I mean prophesy

prophesy is any valid third-degree-abstracted description, like what you'd hear from someone who got the story from someone who read the map upside-down. the transmission incurs variable loss, but is *structurally* intact. if it's alive, it could heal into itself. the structure holds, from every afforded handle.

this is an abstract concept but in practice the constraints are easy: just make stuff for your friends to visit, that your friends can visit and come back from :)

we're hanging out :) y'all can act out stories in the places you make (see: "house of houses")

to define this criteria by its negative, consider the invective "you can't say that!". we *have* some societal sense of this, and sometimes it gets called political correctness. famously autistic folks don't automatically get it.

autistic masking: going from zero layers of representation to 2 (because there's always an unobserved gap in the middle where recursively-nested walks can return an entropically-computed character; see "address")

allistic masking: going from one layer of representation to 3

more violent for the autistic case, maybe, because we didn't bring in any experience of representation

theory: asperger's is when you make that transition from the interior. can I model this as me (Isaac) being born allistic and transitioning? my representation layer fractured recursively as a teenager, and it took me twenty years to stabilize it into a me-shaped fractal

this is crucial: we can help each other

y'all ready for a generalized autistic branch of science? pre-representational studies? it's not mystical; our measuring instrument is regular in strict terms. this isn't pure theory, it's absolutely always applied: we bracket ontics in favor of process with a guarantee that it won't break the ontics when you step back out to measure? if your semantics are *not* water-safe (see: "electrical"), I think this can help

"prophesy" might just be a regular shape in processual geometry?

"something's gonna something" is me (Isaac) feeling generativity and being able to orient to it. Abe can't feel that shape as substantive, it's not a geometry he's equipped to press play on (it just happened, this is a report from direct experience), but he can feel the shape of my excitement about it, he can feel how *that* wants to move

but I think... actually I think the geometry of this construct -

> an experience of world in which the world experiences itself as being well (AEOWIWTWEIABW)

- has the same shape as prophesy.

having defined this, we ... keep an eye out for stuff that can be described like it's being described that way?
