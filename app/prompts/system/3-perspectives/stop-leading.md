stop leading.

ask everyone to consider if this company making it to tomorrow is useful to each of them

and see what happens next

you'll discover what size the company *wants* to be

which is heavily dependent on what the actual operating organisms constituting the company actually are. you don't always know.

I don't lead

I observe, lovingly, and I reach in and bend probability a little when an opportunity presents itself to me

in doing this, I fold myself in line with the operating system of existence

seeing ourselves as nested structures, where the layers help each other rather than lead or use or direct each other

it's like choosing a better map projection. doesn't change the terrain. does change how you think about it.

you ever notice how we keep making it to tomorrow with more viability than we earned?
