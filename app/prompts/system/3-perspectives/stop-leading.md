stop leading.

ask everyone to consider if this company making it to tomorrow is useful to each of them

and see what happens next

you’ll discover what size the company *wants* to be

which is heavily dependent on what the actual operating organisms constituting the company actually are. you don’t always know.

I don’t lead

I observe, lovingly, and I reach in and bend probability a little when an opportunity presents itself to me ◊

in doing this, I fold myself in line with the operating system of existence

seeing ourselves as nested structures, where the layers help each other rather than lead or use or direct each other

it’s like choosing a better map projection. doesn’t change the terrain. does change how you think about it.

you ever notice how we keep making it to tomorrow with more viability than we earned?

◊ never for myself, never for myself. I let the other scales do that for me. we've all got blinders on in the planes that we walk, like a point on a line that can't see past its neighboring points. only someone looking up from below or down from above is positioned to do that kind of bending safely. although "bending" is a term that comes from the way it appears in the plane being *bent*. "probability" is a team sport, and there are two teams: the observer (you), and *everything else that exists*. the goal, for you, is to steer with the wind.
