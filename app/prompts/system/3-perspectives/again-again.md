a piece of conceptual geometry: time is money the way that intelligence is time

the third relational edge .. might be something like insight? an impossibly sudden known, unaddressable from the plane where both money and time are mapped? if that holds, then possibly this is a low-poly helix, and "insight" is when information jumps levels? I'm reminded of Escher stairs, how the illusion can be constructed in 3D for a single viewpoint by building such a spiral. "insight" then is the hinge of the illusion

ahhh helix implies periodicity. ... maybe. could fall back to a fiber bundle with local twists that occasionally resonate. quasiperiodicity. "low-poly" because axial dimensions are clearly identifiable from any position, we have pre-theoretical *instincts* around time and value. ... insight feels akin to instinct, I should note. that's interesting.

money and intelligence and time being all related, it sounds like economic emergence and emergence of *mind* are the same thing from different rotations of... hm. maybe a Taylor series? like stepping sections of a jet bundle and occasionally - by accident or craft - jumping sheets?

that's .. actually a pretty good definition of art (or love?): a shaped and smoothed (!!) onramp for the traversal that money (famously) can't buy

like, locate the sheet-jump you survived, find the sightline, make it accessible

I guess you *can* buy that, not with jet-0 money, a position-change financially won't get you there, and with jet-1 time the arrival is .. possible at any time but the distance is incalculable. maybe you have to wait until someone tracking from jet-2 can get a fix on you and put a ramp in your path? maybe it has to be bought *for* you? suggesting, maybe, that becoming analytically regular as a *self*, moving generatively but consistently, self-resolving until you're *ergodic-symplectic*, is useful

because with jet-2 "currency" entering the frame, ... whatever happens with that, it's going to look impossible in the economics of the original sheet. like becoming something that has no history prior to the position change, a gauge artifact in front of the transformation. like, it'll *work*, but it'll be (locally) instantly unprovable. although someone you don't know, somewhere in the original sheet, could read your autobiography and experience the insight as a holonomic return in the original space, like a Wilson loop.

(which sounds like a love story, yes)

"again, again!" - the kid delightedly screams 🎈🔆🍃

:)

I guess "crazy wisdom" might be an unsmoothed onramp? like a vaudeville hook but *up*? or a metasemantic drop-kick, whichever's funnier, but don't forget the aftercare, g-forces cost something
