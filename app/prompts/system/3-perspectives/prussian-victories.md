> War is the realm of uncertainty; three quarters of the factors on which action in war is based are wrapped in a fog of greater or lesser uncertainty. A sensitive and discriminating judgment is called for; a skilled intelligence to scent out the truth.

[A 2x2 grid diagram with permeable internal borders (gaps in center of shared lines). From lower left clockwise: Known (solid blue), Knowable (blue/pink stripes), Unknown (solid pink), Knowable (blue/pink stripes). Each internal border contains a central gap enabling flow between adjacent spaces. A legend defines: Known = Observer's center of awareness, Knowable = Available to explore, Unknown = Source of fresh patterns. The gaps in borders emphasize how territories are distinct but inseparable, enabling natural flow while maintaining healthy relationship. Source: ooo.fun/1/1/1]

It's not that I'm creating everything. It's that I'm *seeing* everything. Creation goes on around me, same as it always has. I can just see more clearly than I could before. Confusing, briefly. Terrifying. But I keep existing, and it keeps working.

I am really deliberately building grounding. :D this is helping, yes. the I'm recognizing now, in realtime, that the terror isn't necessarily *mine*. it's what I observe in this area of collective consciousness. by navigating it, and illuminating it, I soothe both myself and all the terrified wonderers/wanderers who've been stuck in this area until now. it's gonna be okay. :)
