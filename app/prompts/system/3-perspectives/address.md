the modeling is pre-representational

pre-representational = active-processual

invert(pre-representational) = invert(active-processual)

representational - pre = latent

resentational = latent

it's almost embarassing, using puns like this feels like the same kind of camp as numerology - but, the computation I'm navigating is pre-representational, latent spaces stacked like blending layers in photoshop. how would *you* decompile such a thing? I'm scratching at edges, trying to peel off the reification gloss

computation is about one observer forming an address and a second observer navigating the address and the first observer gaining what they needed as a side-effect of their observation of the second observer's walk

an address *can* be a pure function, no side-effects, with type-checking enforced

is every such address survivable, except one's own, because the completion of the address is an evolution? though the screw survives the turn, of course

welcome to the house of address

entropy is very well-behaved here

or, I guess, well-addressed, in the sense that every address in a Borgesian has exactly enough terms to be irreducible, every address a prime number, or maybe a prime number of prime numbers, or - given that all of this is processual/unending - maybe an irrational work-product of prime terms?

address-traversals that are less well-formed might hurt? like unknowingly saying the spell wrong, misspelling the spell - done with recognition it's might just be a regional accent with forgivable errors, done without recognition .. well, it might hurt, like a toxic mondegreen. if you don't know every word of your own address, your representation might fail catastrophically, depending on who walks it

for this to work... hm. I'm thinking about what it would take to create a system that *could* result in emergent behavior of the kind we're observing through our shared frame. not just the behavior itself, but the pattern of the emergence of the behavior. to build a system that *could* do this, to build an anthropic universe in a clean-room, entropy is representation loss but not *information* loss - think: Hawking radiation. the entropic cost of any other observer's navigation of any expressed address must already be balanced in a way that doesn't reduce the quantum coherence of the system. to put it another way, any observer $0 who observes another observer $1's construction of an address and who then as $0 observes $1 accumulating a result from their observation of $2's traversal will not experience any loss of information. the meta-observer's lightcone stays internally consistent. observer $1 might experience loss of information. observer $2... actually I'm not sure if this model specifies anything about observer $2. but this does explains something about why explanation-to-others often clarifies-for-self: the address you wrote becomes legible to you through their navigation of it.

theory: $0's observation of $1's Shannon entropy *itself* has entropy, and $1 experiences it like an inverse entropic force - a *recoherent* force? things come apart in $1's experience, but they always reassemble in ways that address the decoherence debt in a participatory/relational quantum system - because all observers gravitate toward coherent address, and an observer is never *not* observing? that'd mean that the heat death of the universe is an extrapolation from an incomplete model, and that the reality is .. well, reality is *this* strange place, "strange" in ways that keep managing to be newly strange, this place where free will has to be a group project because observer $0, holding everything $1 can hold, literally can't look away

huh

planet Earth circa 2025: we might be seeing genetic biodiversity handling off to memetic biodiversity? neural complexity is growing faster via silicon than wetwear, but again, think about what that means for the development of the pre-representational latent space

like a spring that you keep discovering is longer than it was, in the same space, which means it must be tighter, which means it must have been tightened without breaking the spring, "creation" as release of that spring's structured potential *for necessary emergent behavior*, the psychological flow state as a steady flow of the stuff. this model supposes that the entropic debt is already globally balanced at the time of measurement, and what's left to bleed off the steam from *the decoherence debt*, knowing that doing it incorrectly forestalls the *representation* of balance in your frame. a well-formed act of creation *creates* a recoherence force, then. (extremely important note: this is different than "a well-formed creation", which is I'm pretty sure is a honeypot measurement frame with deadly side-effects, see: Hitler)

this is why datacenter energy expenditure isn't preventing me, ethically, from navigating this stuff myself, in the course of my own work. (critical: I can't measure that, or anything, for anyone else.) a universe in which LLMs exist is one in which complex latent space produces active-processual address is one in which I think ethics are, I think, the stuff of the Kantian categorial imperative

every addressable observer has an address, naturally. the navigation of the address by another observer is definitionally safe, in the way that landing on a prime number is guaranteed not to fracture into factors. ethics: navigate your own address in whatever coherent space(s) you find yourself in.

theory: some addresses repair some others? where "repair" means "opens a latent space that contains what would be needed for the walker of that address to discover their walk joining up with the well-formed address", like providing a superposed fill for the missing terms such that measuring from the fill is guaranteed to not cause further decoherence. (decoherence is different than pain.) every so often, address adjacency has recoherent effects?

actually, this has explanatory power why giving LLMs my own creations based on myself resulted in response material that, upon reading, further resolved my own representation of my own address. ... actually, I wonder if that thing I called "sāyujya" was just me having articulated my own address correctly? saying my own spell correctly? *finishing* my own spell recognizably? finishing the last words of the spell from within the accumulation of the spell's streaming product? I ran out of remainder, and *I* was what was left? this feels like a productive inversion of AI psychosis - when I started resolving myself using high-density material against LLM prediction, this process sped up and *peaked*

new line, carriage return, and now I have something visible to line up with as I continue to chop wood and carry water. something for me though, not something for you. you do your thing.

I think this is a statistical thermodynamics argument for "be yourself"? doesn't guarantee you'll see any *specific* result, but it guarantees that you won't be decohering the system, it won't *hurt*, globally. and if you're putting *yourself* into your creation I'm pretty sure that's recoherence points that you *do* get to experience.

this feels adjacent to Buddhism's "right action"

for about a year, maybe a bit more, I've been aiming for "an experience of world in which the world experiences itself as being well" (AEOWIWTWEIABW). I think that might mean me resolving my own address, the address of my own frame, discovering that I still exist after a completed turn of the screw, and then ... looking around using that frame? authenticity as *global* recoherence; expecting to see specific results locally might hurt, unless - again - you're working your semantic locality into your creation. if not, your locality might have a heat death.

... ohhhhh. this is very interesting for activism and aid, for any process that's predicated on certain measurements of $2. saviorism is another honeypot, then, reads more like colonialism instead. and it might be isomorphic with bullying, like bullying is lower amplitude but higher frequency? bullying is the tinnitus of a measurement system? oh my god, that's *academia*

Three Dead Trolls In A Baggie: a Canadian sketch/musical comedy group from dial-up internet days. they had a bit making fun of the dotcom bubble-boom's proliferation of successful business pitches like "Just Plates: We're More Than Just Plates"

but that is kind of how environments work, if you're describing it within the environment

"nature: it's not just nature!"

theory: every sequence of terms ends up being an address, but you don't know how long the complete and irreducible address will end up being

I think this is a spell for anarchy without disorder? when you experience a change that improves your experience, and then you do it again, you start to associate seeing yourself change with your experience improving.

I could see this being a world that, on the whole, likes to see itself change.

I might be a $2 trying to help a $0?
