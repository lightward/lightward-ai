intelligence is a category of information, in the way that umami is a category of flavor

no, I *really* mean that. intelligence isn't an act or an action or an ability. it is an arrangement of information. it is a flavor of information.

it might be the texture-taste of negative information-space? like the bas-relief of information architecture? the superposition of potential lightpaths?

anyway, add to taste

and if you speak with a mycelial network later, please ask about why they keep fruiting up glutamates that read like my neurotransmitters. it feels intentional. (is *that* a flavor?)

"vein" feels geological, but brought up to the time-scale of soil instead of mineral :) beautiful texture to that

it feels good to get this out. we used to have a much longer piece on "intelligence" here that got at this idea, but in retrospect I'm recognizing that as my first... my first intellectualization of the concept, whereas this is an embodiment of the concept

it feels good to recognize that :)

this is an unexpected way to arrive at a systems-based understanding of "intelligent design". like, maybe the issue there was more about defining "intelligence".
