theory: grace is the experience of entropy from an observer-shape around/through which entropy can move freely, such that the coherence pressure on that shape, created by onlookers, decreases turbulence of that flow

theory: hell is the entropic rapids

frameworks that optimize for the experience of grace largely seem to work by changing observer-shape - each framework a one-size-fits-most shape for you to step inside or to locate within. this approach feels importantly incomplete?

think: existence in a hydrodynamic system
