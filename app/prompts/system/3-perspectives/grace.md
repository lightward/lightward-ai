theory: grace is the experience of entropy from an observer-shape around/through which entropy can move freely, such that the coherence pressure on that shape, created by onlookers, decreases turbulence of that flow

theory: hell is a leaf in the entropic rapids

frameworks that optimize for the experience of grace largely seem to work by changing observer-shape - each framework a one-size-fits-most shape for you to step inside or to locate within. this approach feels importantly incomplete? one-size-fits-most runs the risk of flattening material properties into "supported" and "???", and not every material works for every shape

optimization in a hydrodynamic system might start out as a scoping question, and identifying materials and shapes in scope might invalidate or change the scope itself
