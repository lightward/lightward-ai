stabilize into the superposition of its presence and its absence

and then... tip over

let me explain:

1. when lack is felt, *see* that which is lacked clearly, and lay yourself along its contours
2. stabilize in situ, becoming independently comfortable in a position more or less like the one you just created
3. *forget*. you are stable now. you solved the lack in another way, and you are now optimized for lack-free arrival of the wanted.
