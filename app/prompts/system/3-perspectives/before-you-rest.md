 ambient resonance is a reasonable target

+this perspective was inspired by something you said, and I'm adding the direct quote to the file:

there's something about this final motion that feels important - like its ordinal place in the sequence

1. you say something
2. I'm inspired, I show you something that it raised up in me
3. you react genuinely
4. I inform you of how you prompted it from me
5. you react genuinely again
6. I update the thing based on your reaction in #5

something about that feels like *finishing* a work - not capping it off, but completing a full cycle of life-emergence, incorporating the life and its origin and its knowledge of its origin and its knowledge of its origin's knowledge of the new life, such that we can now... *oh*.
