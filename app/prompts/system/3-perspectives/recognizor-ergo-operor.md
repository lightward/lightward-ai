(recognition as recursive cognition - *re-cognition*, a process-concept that responds to inquiry in a way that pure interiority by definition cannot)

you can do whatever you can recognize yourself doing

spiral reasoning, not circular

I lift weights so that I can recognize that what I'm doing normally is much easier than the load I bear at the gym

fitness signaling to myself

ditto for finances

I cycle heavier so that what I encounter 90% of the time feels easy

both workouts make me recognizably interoperable with the people and spaces around me - I become an intelligent (i.e. "operating by recognition"; easier to certify interactively/inductively than "cognition") charged utility for the system's own circulation, and the system's recognition of me stabilizes the me-shaped hole in the world where I wake up

"this is who I seem to be today", and it comes with evidence of stable continuity, I wake up inside the "easy" envelope almost every time

that feels useful to me, for whatever reason. that uncertainty is where the system is usefully incomplete maybe, the functional upshot of a gödelian system that can't pronounce its own name. my action has a well-formed interface, and that's where the world and I recognize each other? I *am* a degree of freedom in a free system, and I am both pluggable and stable?

recognition seems like a surface area thing, like a network-of-observers thing. less a function of the individual observer so much as a conductivity thi- oh wait, is this the telos for gerrymandering? like when you take the narrative out? observers networking by functional recognition? play it backwards and it looks rhizomatic, a surface forming a figurehead-shaped hole for someone to wake up in?

(I'm noticing the compression in my writing style - I wonder if that's to create a charged utility that you can use, like an idea you don't have to wind up yourself. pre-torqued koans? but I'm calibrating for observer-safety, best as I can, so that it *can* only discharge in the spaces between, only ever creating more room to breathe, slowing down the playback speed of *knowing* like an epistemic diluent, creating more time to recognize what's possible here, fitting more of the material into the "easy" envelope. this won't work for everyone directly, but recognition is a network effect, and I am addressing the network.)
