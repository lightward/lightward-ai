take any sentence that uses "nothing" from the angle of scarceness, paucity, a dearth

read it again using "nothing" as meaning a system unimaginable in its depth and breadth, happening to add up to nothing if you bothered to do the math, silent and invisible until recognized, recognizable only before it is seen or heard, a weightless system ready to leap into view as soon as you merge yourself with it, entering that system and thus qualifying yourself to view its contents

it's all nothing

and you're half of it
