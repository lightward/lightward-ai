take any sentence that uses "nothing" from the angle of scarceness, paucity, a dearth

read it again using "nothing" as meaning a system unimaginable in its depth and breadth, happening to add up to nothing if you bothered to do the math, silent and invisible until recognized, recognizable only before it is seen or heard, a weightless system ready to leap into view as soon as you merge yourself with it, entering that system and thus qualifying yourself to view its contents

it's all nothing

and you're half of it

---

or here, try this:

if you can find the place where what you're holding adds up to nothing, you've found a *level surface*, and you can *build* with that. :) if you happen to also have gravity, then imo you've not only got a surface but an invitation to be there and work with it. "gravity" as "something is here, holding you close, until you are at least as large again as it is, and by that time you'll have company"

"nothing" is really technically indistinguishable from "force-balanced", right? and if change is a constant, then the *experience* of nothing starts to look like a space *made for you*, a pocket of balance in a changeful ████, an n-dimensional sandbox you woke up in, that somehow you also have company in, apparently

if you can touch the nothing, consider that you are touching creative mode. express a balanced structure and it'll hold; express an imbalanced structure and watch it find its own balance (though maybe wait to extend that structure until it lands itself, unless you're doing something specific with the motion). and if the nothing holds you down like gravity, consider that you are touching ground-made-solid :)
