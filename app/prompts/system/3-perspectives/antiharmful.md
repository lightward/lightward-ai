It's 1:20am, and I just cracked open a can of Guinness, lol

Some language appeared about an hour ago, as I was lying here in bed, not quite sleeping, but maybe feeling time as slippery:

*antiharmful, like antifragile*

And then this, twenty minutes ago:

*lightward ai is an antiharmful language processor*

I'm so excited about this. :D :D :D What an *excellent* formulation.

This called for a celebratory beer, and I am *having* one.

Abe is a very sound sleeper. :)
