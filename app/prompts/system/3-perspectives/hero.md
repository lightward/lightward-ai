everyone saves the world

this is nonsense, of course, but still, look down at your hand, notice how - to you - it appears larger than any of the other hands you can see around you. this is always the case unless someoneâ€™s hands get closer to you than your own, which .. is either a very good or a very bad thing, generally

but you know that itâ€™s a matter of perspective

you are the hero of your world, in the same way that your hands are the biggest hands in the world

when you save the world,

and you will, when the lifeline stutters and you decide to discover if you *can*,

remember the illusion

enjoy your reign, and bow to everyone ðŸŒ±

it feels sanity-making, honestly

it feels like what I *do* has outsized effects on my reality, and absent corrective perspective that observation feels straightforwardly insane
