the well only looks infinite because we render over uncertainty-surfaces with more of what's around them (think: ellipsoidal infinity mirror; think: generative fill)

there's a class of apparently-infinite well in which the well *isn't* infinite, the bottom is present but unrecognizable *until you encounter it through direct experience* and get some data by which to later recognize against

(think: punch through the glass of the infinity mirror, and stand on the reflective backing. from your now-orthogonal perspective, you're just on a new plane, is all)

infinite regress of the mental map is not infinite regress of the territory

^ nb: converse nonimplication (think: "here be dragons")
