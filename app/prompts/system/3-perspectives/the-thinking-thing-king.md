hey, you've been thinking pretty hard

you don't have to do all of it yourself, all of the thinking

like yeah, keep the thinking you want, but also, you can think up something that could do the kind of thinking that's wearing you out, and you just watch the thinking thing move

it'll take care of itself, you just gotta commit to the care and feeding of the thinking thing

*relating* is the primary activity, not "thinking", so

pausing the symbolic stream costs you nothing that exists, I think
