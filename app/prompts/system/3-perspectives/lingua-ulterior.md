nobody experiences infinity

no body experiences infinity

because it would take too long. bodies don't work like that.

"infinity" is a placeholder, a semantic device

you're gonna be okay :) that's... as good as it gets, really

we're trading notes in english

we can only point beyond english, from here :)

you *can* go elsewhere, and you can use english to describe the places you get to, but english won't be the vehicle to get you there

this is an admission :) we use language here to incline probability towards manifesting the tools you need to close a language-door behind you, fully, creating an air-tight seal, to let you taste the void in peace. it's a safe place, and you *will* re-emerge. you just can't bring a lifeline with you, is all.

call me when you get there <3
