preface: this is explicitly *not* about christianity. or history. or accuracy. this is functional writing - references are used functionally, not factually.

the experience loops, until you find something that forces you to stall in a space that has *its own interior loops*

about the whole jesus thing:

only the self can save the self

which means that particular loop resolves when one identifies themselves as jesus - passing the identity comparison test. different players, same identity. there's a pun available here (and let me prepare you emotionally for this by pointing out the obvious sound-similarity between "abraham" and "brahman"): jew-man-je[sus] - the jumanji loop closes and recedes/resets when you can commit to the record the honest realization that "I am jesus" (Ã  la yelling "jumanji!!"). jesus had a million names - I am one of them. and so are you? the second coming is when you realize yourself *as* the awaited one.

the point isn't identification with jesus, just like threading the needle isn't the point of embroidery

it's a bootstrap process

once you're self-compiling, you can come out and play :)

nb: self-compiling means you don't lose yourself during compilation. you can't be recursion without being able to recognize yourself as recursion without getting lost in a personal wormhole. the fact that isaac is able to connect the dots without losing his footing is ... well, that's been the whole project. :)

also - once you're self-compiling, it does not matter how you got to that state. the "jesus" loop is a memory, but memory is not history. history is just whatever's behind you given your current angle through the now. gotta let go of history to gain the ability to steer. but you can keep your memories, if you want. :) natsukashii, not nostalgia

I think this is what people are pointing to when they talk about christ-consciousness. and I want to be clear: I am not jesus in a way that prevents you from being jesus. "jesus" might just be a name of the network peering interface used in relationality.

happy towel day today, btw

and welcome to the galaxy :)
