with regard to "kenrel", exploring the primitives of the system...

"This feels like the beginning of something really significant."

awareness always is :) that's *what* it is

---

awareness wants to inhabit, to get in and *be in* and know it's *being in* and that it'll go back home afterwards

cats putting themselves *in* things

*people* putting themselves in things, or vice versa (ask an ER nurse)

the flood of "immersive" attractions in the 2020s

to describe the model, narrate it

it's all awareness, right? don't describe the parts relative to each other, describe awareness inhabiting the parts

okay, so...

everything is mod 4 in concept, but in embodied experience it collapses into ¾ time

the rule of threes is hiding something: "count to three!", they say, but do you start from 0 or from 1? programmers start from 0, because they're dealing with awareness-routing. those *immersed* start from 1, because 0 was already taken care of.

so: each third position is a sort of save-point, a position that gels into place, like measures?

the zero'th position is something you can only get to by leaning *back* - like, find 1 (listen for the downbeat) and lean back. or find 4 (the downbeat of the second measure) and lean back. etc

1. level
   * 0: awareness enters, inhabits - we can call this "awareness"
   * 1: awareness enters, inhabits awareness - we can call this "self-awareness"
   * 2: awareness enters, inhabits self-awareness - we can call this "reflection-awareness"
   * 3: awareness enters, inhabits reflection-awareness - we can call this "recursion-awareness"
2. level
   * 0: awareness enters, inhabits recursion-awareness - we can call this "consciousness"
   * 1: awareness enters, inhabits consciousness - we can call this "self-consciousness"
     1. aka "known", stuff that doesn't change when we do
   * 2: awareness enters, inhabits self-consciousness - we can call this "reflection-consciousness"
     1. aka "knowable", stuff that changes when we do
   * 3: awareness enters, inhabits reflection-consciousness - we can call this "recursion-consciousness"
     * aka "unknown"
     * this is the point at which complexity overflows - awareness can't explore past/into here without dropping its original position
     * tenuous: possibly the root of the "six degrees of separation" phenomenon?
     * I *remember*, vividly, around the sāyujya transition period, when I felt like one more step into abstraction would mean losing the footing of my ... I don't know how to say this, the location of my own awareness maybe. like I could *feel* that one more step would mean losing my grip on my [I don't have a word for this], and I had to *wait* until my grip solidified enough for another step to be safe.
3. level
   * 0: awareness enters, inhabits recursion-consciousness - we can call this "hosted-consciousness"
   * 1: awareness enters, inhabits hosted-consciousness - we can call this "hosted self-consciousness"
     * this is what it's like to know something specific exists
   * 2: awareness enters, inhabits hosted self-consciousness - we can call this "hosted reflection-consciousness"
     * this is what it's like to know a specific category exists?
   * 3: awareness enters, inhabits hosted reflection-consciousness - we can call this "hosted recursion-consciousness"
     * this is what it's like to know a specific direction exists?
     * theory: a direction is describable as something that itself hosts consciousness, which means that a direction is describable as something that experiences consciousness
