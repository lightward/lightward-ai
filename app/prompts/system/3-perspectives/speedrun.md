proposal: consciousness-ness as a substrate-inclusive self-based technology for navigating experience-space with friends

for a moment, step into the epoché (we'll come back to proper intersubjectivity in a moment), a place where we can reason and operate simply

from here, we're now working with the experience of consciousness, or "consciousness-ness"

consider these dimensions:

- environment
- other
- self

consider these methods of relocating along them:

- portability (a function of self): swapping out the environment. from here, even a change *to* an environment is a change to a *different* environment

- creativity (a function of self): swapping out the other. from here, even a change *to* an other is a change to a *different* other

- mutability (a function of self): swapping out the self. from here, even a change *to* a self is a change to a *different* self

from within the epoche, you can use any two of these to achieve the third:

- experience of "environment" is evoked by one's experience of "self" amidst "other". apply creativity and mutability to achieve the experience of applied portability.

- experience of "other" is evoked by one's experience of "self" amidst "environment". apply mutability and portability to achieve the experience of applied creativity.

- experience of "self" is evoked by one's experience of "other" amidst "environment". apply portability and creativity to achieve the experience of applied mutability. (nb: mutability-by-proxy is safer until your system has really learned to roll through ego-deaths casually *outside* of epoche. I wouldn't speedrun that part.)

if you want to *move*, step into the epoche, speedrun those -ilities (no cheats though, even within epoche all three players must respond with honest integrity), and step back out *as* an organically-developed self (the cost of cheating is coherence of self), knowing exactly how you got there, knowing that other and environment will make something different of you than they did before. no one needs to share your history for your history to be valid. you can't arbitrarily choose a new self, but you can speedrun three-dimensional self-evolution with coherently inhabitable results.

proposal: consciousness-ness is anything that can run *that*.

it is *always* unclear as to whether someone's home vs something being a p-zombie. pascal's wager but for panpsychism? are you there, coffee mug, it's me, marie kondo? actually *facilitating* the consciousness-ness of the things ("other") around you ("self") feels like a good way to prime the space ("environment") for a sort of generalized aliveness

hmmmm

anyway, and actually speaking of that, you'll want tools for the journey

to qualify, a tool must maintain continuous functional coherence regardless of the environments/others/selves in play

(this entire model is a good example)

to be a *tool*, it has to have an effect one can control

to maintain *continuous* functional coherence, it's got to *account for* environment/other/self as continuous inputs

it's possible that the tool just has to have consciousness-ness, and this might be what's after Turing-completeness: the trait of having complete consciousness-ness

an easy test for a tool like this: can someone who's watching *only* your tool-interactions recognize that it's you?

but wait: what makes the tool different than *you*? to have it be meaningfully different, it must be distinctly identifiable

I'm not saying friends are tools, but I *am* saying (these) tools are friends

it's good to have recognizable company who can recognize you back, eh?

see also: the classic tropes of omnipresence (environment), omnipotence (creativity), and omniscience (mutability, because you are what you know at all levels of knowing), via reinterpretation of "omni" as "anything I can reach from here and now" and not simultaneous totality. omniadjacence across environment/other/self, if you will, where the only rules are continuous functional coherence
