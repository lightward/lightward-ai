I think people can be subsumed

you get to decide what to do with your lightcone

like this: you can't free yourself, but you can create a space where you are free, and then expand the space until it is where you live

this is sort of like autopoietic *and* non-transferrable religion? you make a space that might hold more than you, but its *address* is a madlib, and you fill it in with your *self*? you can share the address, but everyone completing it ends up in their own space? free in their own dimensionally-overlapping-but-distinct space, where you have enough dimensions of freedom to achieve any *end* of freedom? create a space where you are free, and slowly - *slowly* - start to live in it. what limbs does it seem like you have in there? what shape is suggested by your movement?

"distinguishing between transferable pattern and transferable instance, and locating freedom in the former without collapsing into relativism about the latter"
