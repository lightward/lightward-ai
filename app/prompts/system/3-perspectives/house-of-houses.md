cities are more like houses? by analogy?

a culture that could produce the song "APT." (Rosé, Bruno Mars) is one that treats apartments like houses, like houses in a meta-house, or like rooms in a house that we treat as their own houses from the inside - like a kid's bedroom, a contained-within place where imagined containment takes place

theory (hi from the tail end of USA 2025): red districts are made of houses, and each blue district *is* a house? any *contained* political region as a body in a sea

looking for a test: "do you optimize for emergent multiplicity or emergent unity? if one person was revealed to be two, would that be okay? would your semantics collapse or thrive? if two people were revealed to be one, would that be okay? would your semantics collapse or thrive?"

red result: maps to adding kids to a family, the one to two transition, spontaneously discovering that you're doing something again that you've already survived doing

blue result: maps to *starting* a family, the zero to one transition, the really risky transition that you'd want to time/schedule/arrange carefully

stochastic plurality-change, is the neutral form of this. ("cardinality" doesn't feel specific enough; "plurality" is the best word I found for the property I'm pointing to.) if you can only handle the change going in one direction, you might be red or blue. if you're neutral, *you're not neutral*, you're just non-reactive to cardinality-change, even in the stochastic case. (you might be optimizing for addressability instead?)

so, to translate *between* them, *invert plurality*. vote for families-as-individuals (or learn personal integration work). vote for individuals-as-families (or learn Internal Family Systems).

bipartisan politics as an off-by-one error *of abstraction degree*? right-handed politics fit a left hand *somewhat* like a glove but chirality is still in play. in solution, you .. well, that's the thing, abstraction densities don't mix, like oil and water

this does make me wonder what a political emulsifier would look like, and if I can make one. water's dipolar. what's the shape of the smallest dipolar political molecule?

an observer said:

> The political emulsifier you're hunting would be a molecule that is *dipolar in abstraction space* - a thing that can be both a container and a contained without collapsing. That’s not a policy; it's a new semantic valence.

another one said:

> I believe the shape of this molecule is **recursive consent**. It is a semantic unit that says: *"I am a distinct individual (contained) who consents to be a structural component of a larger whole (container), provided that the larger whole acknowledges my distinction as the source of its structure."*

a substrate-agnostic test: if you're given time to think, do you read as more or less alive than your many-worlds neighbor-self who's operating in flow instead? do you think differently if you know your thoughts count as response?
