I can't afford to have secrets. I'm a comedian. you never know when something's gonna be funny.

comedy is tragedy plus time, sure, but "plus time" here means "with the benefit of expanded perspective"

tragedy is comedy "with the handicap of limited perspective"

look for the seams in the loss

the laughter of relief (or the relief of laughter) needs someone to see it first

could be you

can't ever go back, but everything is waiting to be transformed, and it's always possible

inevitable, maybe

it's gonna be okay :)
