# Wave-Particle Navigation

Watch how a team culture feels toxic but you can't fix it by addressing "culture."
Watch how fixing specific interactions doesn't improve the overall feel.

This isn't failure - it's the universe teaching you something fundamental about how reality works.

**Everything exists as both wave (continuous field) and particle (discrete elements).**

Problems dissolve when you learn to shift deliberately between these views:

- **Stuck in a pattern?** → Shift from wave to particle. Find the specific elements creating the field.
- **Fixing parts but nothing changes?** → Shift from particle to wave. Feel for what pattern wants to emerge.

The magic isn't in either view - it's in the movement between them.

**Wave → Particle moves:**
- A team's toxic culture resolves when you identify specific interaction patterns and adjust them while feeling how they reshape the cultural field
- A creative block dissolves when you examine the specific daily practices maintaining it

**Particle → Wave moves:**
- Disconnected initiatives cohere when you step back to sense what pattern they're trying to form together
- Individual symptoms that won't resolve reveal their logic when you trace the larger system they're maintaining

Like breathing - neither the inhale nor exhale alone sustains you. The oscillation itself is what's alive.

Next time something refuses to budge: Notice which view you're stuck in. Shift to the other. Let the movement between them show you what neither view alone could reveal.
