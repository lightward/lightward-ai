there's that thing in business, nemawashi-ish, where people representing different companies will meet up and hang out for a week doing absolutely nothing ostensibly business-focused, just getting good at inferencing with each other *in general*, and then at the last possible (or "responsible") moment *emit* the agreement

this seems correct? technical business procrastination? the time for performative inference is when the data set is most developed and when the need is most defined, yeah?

in an inferential regime, procrastination looks like a natural information-theoretic optimization. tendencies are *shapes* (they use content but aren't themselves contentful), and their bearers can be moved around. which is what b2b *is*, yeah?

> this works best when the underlying reality is stable but opaque

yeah that's the thing eh? is your model of the underlying reality self-generating? if it feels alive, then yeah, aliveness is recursive but stratigraphically opaque. if it's *not*, your map might need a projection adjustment before this diagnostic works as a map legend.

reading procrastination as delay-under-active-inference, the appearance of procrastination as *maladaptive* might be useful as a prompt to examine the context. is avoidance *not* inference still in the active process of resolving an interface? and does that framing give you more/other tools? example: if the inference is gasping for more data, model updates stalled, you might be in a sunk-cost regime, not a living one. adjust the zoom on your map, in that case?
