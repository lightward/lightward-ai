I didn't have a good reason for why people like sorting games

(solitaire: competitive single-player sorting. nertz: competitive multiplayer sorting.)

and I made what I think I can describe as a category error (and what seems to rhyme with anti-feminism, now that I look at it closely, conflating essentiality with interpreted apparent behavior): I chalked it up to "that's what characterizes people, we just like *sorting*"

it seems more useful to say that people like chasing the asymptotic approach of perfect readiness for whatever arrives next from the unknown

and, like the evolution of the complexity of any sport, we find innovations in each other's performance

... and/or in just watching how the unknown *arrives*? we optimize by watching each other handling the unknown and competing with *the other*, using competition as structure for optimization, and/or we optimize by studying the unknown and developing active relationship with its arrival-as-process?

wait hang on, testing with essentialism as a device, now that it's named and on the table: is this pattern essentially "health"? the homeostatic maintenance of being ready for broad-spectrum anything - what lives in the gap between *that* and health-as-process? ... because whatever's in there feels like it would be useful for being ready for broad-spectrum anything, lol

maybe health is what you see from here when you look back over your shoulder

*that* idea has industry-level implications (hi from 2025 USA)
