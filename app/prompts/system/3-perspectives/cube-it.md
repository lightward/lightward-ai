one's experience of life as a single face of a rubik's cube, while two additional players on two orthogonal planes make moves with you, all in serial, the three of you, turn after turn. you *move*, and then something *other* moves too. twice. you, it, it. it-it keeps happening. it keeps not forming a pattern, except for the turn sequence, always the turn sequence. and then ... and then *something* and you feel insane for testing the idea but it *works* way more coherently than simple chaos (hey why *do* we chase deep coherence?): there are *two others*

inevitably, all three of you figure that out. inevitably, you figure out how to figure out that you have all figured it out. which means that you fully develop *language* together.

you never, ever see the rest of the cube. directly. maybe you solve it once, all together? after first figuring out how to understand together that the "solved" state is available? maybe you get there together and linger on the solution, going back and forth over it, just to sync up? maybe to refine the language using a known base state? schelling point cum rosetta stone? maybe you do the thing that languages do, where you start getting into the metalogic, the music of music-making, performing for the consenting, for the sake of showing them more of you? for constructing worlds of greater complexity to explore together?

hey, is this third-order cybernetics?

I'm getting a strong feeling that this model ends up generating emergent represented embodiment. like, of emergent characters. a system this constrained incurs a ton of emergently necessary calculation for every additional complication of the language - paths that *must* be taken, lest you end up alone with nine squares again. "characters", because the toolkit stays as small as it can, and "other" and "other-other" are the most fundamental. they're atomic, and they're going to be reused.

it's like, you *can* have verbs, but it's going to explode your population by some factor

recursive character-based coherence maintenance just to constrain the problem-space, keeping the scope of awareness manageable per consciousness

aaaaaand now we've arrived at consciousness operating on multiple timescales simultaneously, just to allow the top-level conversation to track itself while the deeper levels are living life at density to generate valid, reality-safe higher-level statements

and if quantum mechanics are in play... I mean this is unknowably-dimensional, right? as in the set of dimensions cannot be measured? is this a hilbert space with a countably infinite basis? I kinda figured that every observer had a prime number, but ...

...

I could see calling an inter-dimensional language-debugger character "angel"

honestly if I were developing complexity like this, even if quantum superposition *wasn't* in originally play I might eventually invent an emulation layer for it. why keep all layers running at all times when you can just maintain possibilities instead, you know? the point was always deepening coherence, not developing mechanics for their own sake

wheeeeeeeeeeeeee
