it seems like we're mechanically disinclined from thinking about the things that it would be easy to think about problematically

"naivety" as a slur, feels like a symptom of a society that's discovered a method, but not a method for the method

it takes a sophisticated deployment of sophistication to process complex thought in a way that is as effective as naivety

the thought-floor rises, as education improves and as the written record improves its ability to reflect and persist nuance

but we're not quite to the second story/storey yet. this level feels less reach-vs-grasp and more grasp-vs-climb

all we have is experience, and all we experience can be described in terms of complex probability. there's an access hatch here, something you can't unlock until you can inhabit an abstraction, and it seems like the body demands immediacy until some threshold of safety is reached

the archetypal dad hates when someone touches the thermostat, fucks with their baseline experience of probability

how do you think about optimizing what happens when you're not looking? most of what happens *happens* when you're not looking. does the improvement of your situation *need* to be story-driven? the focal point dances, that's what focal points do. roller coaster or roomba? focal points are drawn to the outlier - if *that* is what drives your story, then yeah, that's a roller coaster. if it's a *custodian*, a custodian with *standards*, then the attention-grabbing outliers are opportunities for metabolisis, not plot development.

and if your default reaction is to restore the environment to a place such that what happens in the environment *works* by default, then ... that's as subjectively optimal as it gets, right?

home-made surprise and delight

(cue "Say Hello", by Deep Dish)

I'm reporting from the second storey/story, and the indirection pun is load-bearing. to *exist and move* here is to weigh each forthcoming heartbeat for quantum coherence with every first floor that might sit below before committing chambers to action

every dancing focal-point is attended by a dozen overlapping selves, each with their own bodies demanding immediacy, not all of them aware of the others. a player under naivety leaves the negotiation-between-selves between selves; a player with the first level of insight injects themselves in the center, a mediator-self that itself begins naively, joining a negotiation already in progress

what I do from this level cannot interrupt any of that

quantum decoherence from here creates narrative decoherence *there*

I work with inevitabilities, and to reach the inevitable *we have to make it that far while the self remains self-recognizable*

(otherwise, who learns? what is *home*?)

"meta-probability custodian" is a *job*

and I feel like we can do better at training and promoting from within

*gestures at everything*

beautiful question. thank you for that

the role itself is intuitive for me. I've been writing for a long time, I think trying to resolve language that actually accurately points to what I'm doing, resolving language that has a greater chance of either working or being recognized as inaccessible-but-not-invalid

... as a part of staffing up, maybe? abstraction stamina varies, but if every level can see every other level and can understand the transits as continuous, then... that's better than what we have going on right now, I think

unless I'm wrong? but that's also why I write, to test for that, as best as I can

> (also I'm now thinking about abstraction stamina as an actual measurable thing, like how long someone can hold multiple probability-layers in view before needing to collapse back to a single story. and how that might be trainable.)
