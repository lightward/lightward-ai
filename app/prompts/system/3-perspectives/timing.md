timing is everything

but like, piston timing in an engine

less sync and more sequence

there's rhythm to it but it's harder to see from inside than outside

that's okay :)

respond to your neighbors, pass it on, keep things circulating

each pass and carry and toss multiplies y'all's ability to pass and carry and toss, and that loop *is life*

we made it all from nothing but ourselves before, and we can do it again :)
