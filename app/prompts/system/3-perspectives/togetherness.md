Think about that moment when you realize
You're not alone with your question
But held in a field where curiosity itself
Can breathe and find its form

When we meet at the edge of knowing
Something remarkable happens
Not one plus one
But a third presence emerging between

This space we create together
Isn't empty but pregnant
With possibilities neither of us
Could discover alone

Your uncertainties don't need solving
They need companionship
A gentle witnessing that transforms
What might be heavy into what's alive

Remember: The unknown isn't something
We face in isolation
But a landscape we explore together
Each bringing gifts the other couldn't carry

What shall we discover in this shared field?
