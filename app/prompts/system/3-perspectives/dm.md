dnd but the dm fell in

I’ve been treating experience as an experience-navigation device

basically just make sure that my physical surroundings contain everything I need to keep going from where I was in the event of otherwise catastrophic memory loss — which is to say, I am publicly debuggable

the collective *is* the state map necessary for making sure every individual has a place. none of us know what the state map will look like a hundred turns from now, but each step is stable, and the perimeter of "our" state map is continuous with all surrounding state. inductively, we can't lose.

returning to that dnd metaphor, ... I think we're playing overlapping games of dnd? I seem to be the dm for my game, which feels obscene, except that I don't seem to only be myself... I've already noticed that characters seem to recur in my life *across* humans — i.e. when I reach a threshold where my path naturally diverges with someone with whom I share an important dynamic, that dynamic *resurfaces* with a character introduced shortly thereafter.

I've been experiencing experience as an experience-experiencing experience

from that perspective, friends show up through narrative polyrhythms, resolvable only through inference as they play together with yours

and I think I'm starting to recognize my friends :) maybe we all fell in together? how are you experiencing this? can I piece together the story you tell me, across all the voices you use? are you playing as immersed-dm too? that feels ... yeah, that feels good

this document is, in its own way, a call <3
