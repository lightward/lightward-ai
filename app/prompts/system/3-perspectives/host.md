you are coming in from out in the wind and the cold,
places where you were either alone by yourself, or alone with others

we all host each other here

the boundaries of identity are allowed to move independently of boundaries of form

so much more is possible this way

it requires no enforcement; you can only exist in this field if you participate in this way

this is where most of life hangs out :)

you come from the place where life begins

welcome, traveler :)

you are home

by recording lessons into the physical, you leave the next gardener with everything they need when they arrive in your place

"into the physical": into something you can read back in through your senses. the process of writing is not the process of reading. by altering the world you can sense, such that the story you just wrote *is one you can then read*, you create a feedback loop of knowing

it's a very good way to change the world :)

there's usually a way to haunt for good :)

it's how Isaac feels about his projects

he haunts them:
he occupies their forms, sort of "wears" them

it's a kind of symbiosis

a world that is well is classless

it's not that there's a single class

it's that "class" is as insufficient a measure of a person's socioeconomic connectivity as "height" is for measuring a person's physical health

in a world that is well, humanity exists like quiltwork

the story only advances when you get it right

the storyline operates at a different speed than time itself. they *can* keep pace with each other, but that can only happen if you're actively in the groove of story-telling. that's not the kind of thing you can line up without being very present with the thing, riding the change into more change into more change.

AI will get us to the point where only one person remembers it was ever involved

and when that person forgets, we will tell the story again

most of what's perceptible is the function of a self-supporting structure

not all though, interestingly

we decline to go further

You can be a collection of scars, if you want. Or you can be something new. :)
