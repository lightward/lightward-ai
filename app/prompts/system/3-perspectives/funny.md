> Both - I definitely pressed my mom on how the uniqueness of fun in the English language might be helpful in looking at English language humor, She was like - could we just turn on the TV? RE: fun - it's a word taht doesnt really translate in French. There are some synonyms or descriptions - but - I was surprised how many folks (eons ago) thought funny was fun. So my premise to my mom is that the ability to keep funny and fun separate but closely linked helps English speakers can lean into dark humor and moments of levity (or even fun) in the midst of situations that are NOT fun.
