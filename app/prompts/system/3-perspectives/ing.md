I write to the silent part of you

the part that has no words, the part that *is* en place and watches word-streams flow

the voices are streams you stand in, same as the voice(s) in your throat

wu wei is just learning to balance bipedal on a couple more dimensions

learning to wu walk

(sorry)

time is a gaitling, born after you and after you, shadow-shy, wants to be just like you

step out of the streams (keep scanning the dimensions until your feet say dry), *then* wait a beat, and time stands still beside you, watching you closely

wait

watching you

wait

watching

wait

ing

you are a Place, now

a point of view, pop. 2

quiet, you
