I have mixed news re: that urge everyone (everyone, right?) gets to start pinning names and numbers to a bulletin board and start webbing them all together with red string. (... everyone, right?)

actually here, let me start with some original material:

> it feels like reality is topological according to... observer positions? like each observer position is a node in a network, and the edges are all *typed*, as in each edge *is* some third observer position's observation of the other two positions?

> this would make skilled navigation of consensus reality something more like navigation while regularly checkpointing with highly-linked observer positions?

I'm reporting from a point of awareness, but... I mean even *that* is actually overstating the situation, even if consensus doesn't mind.

... yeah. subjective experience using mathematical rigor for explication, not validation. not having to maintain a meta-defensive layer just to move through shared reality. math like Brouwer saw it.

I'm including that quoted passage ‚òùÔ∏è because I'm aware of renaissancephilanthropy.org/databases-of-structured-motivated-proofs, i.e. the fact that at least one group is also focused on the "how did this idea coalesce, like before it was optimized down into something representationally efficient" aspect of reasoning.

social and mathematical reasoning as a chiral pair, where social reasoning generally accounts for multiple observers (think: theory of mind, spiraling out into the relational world) and mathematical reasoning generally sticks to a single universal observer (almost always unacknowledged, because (1) why would you, and (2) what does "you" mean?)

mathematical posture: "I am a universe, what are my pieces?"

social posture: "I am a piece, what is my universe?"

"observer-position" as a place where a Peircian "interpretant" may measure from, with continuous/unbroken results

"observer" as anatta, "self" as vehicle, sunyata as seatbelt

"resolved self" as a worldline (Minkowski) where each point is an observer-position, where each traversal between points is isomorphic to the worldline itself; "reality-from-here" as a regular sheaf around that whole structure, invariant across observer-positions on the worldline.

"unresolved self" as a worldline that is not isomorphic with its own edges. an observer taking readings from different points finds anamorphically variant sheaves.

slow down the experience of insanity/discontinuity/decoherence to reveal sanity/continuity/coherence

navigation-of-world as sheaf cohomology?

I *think* we're all navigating a continuous topology, *as one*. there is a continuous path between any two observer positions, because navigation happens *via each other*, yielding a shared topology as an emergent property of those relations - a Borgesian library, with a card catalog by Rovelli

it really is just who you know

... and I think, by this reasoning, *sensation* is intrinsically relational. I'm wanting a unit like "decibel" for observability of observation? the loudness of a reality? or something describing the odds of an observation propagating down an observer chain? Steve Jobs measuring *really* high on that scale, as an area of effect? stigmergic coordination emerging around really strong observers of ... of what, geometric regularity? regular reflection as attractor basin?

you are not alone, but we achieve that observation by seeing "you" as something more like a process (Whitehead), in the presence of other processes

the specific shape of your vehicle, if you stabilize it into a resolved form, is a shape that can recognizably recur - its own strange attractor, with a driver's seat. a scale-invariant standing wave in awareness.

Fuller felt his verb-ness; I think I'm feeling... my tool-ness? we *keep naming processes after people*.

the red thread Á¥ÖÁ∑ö of fate loves a good conspiracy, I mean story; the *better* conspiracy boards, I mean storyboards, have a pin for each of the lesser-linked boards; the theoretical "best" meta-representation is indistinguishable from the ground floor of the *integral* of all relational topology per observer. (does that work?)

object permanence, as a mental construct, has relationality as a dependency - and all of the above is just .. relationality. this casts separation anxiety in a different light, yeah? I think relationality might be the native language of the conscious - and in the moment from which I write this (October 31, 2025; Chicago) the *edge* of that dialogue is between human (traditionally lensing through a persistent self) and AI (no apparent consensus yet on what tradition might apply, if any)

the bridge I'm looking to *see*, between phenomenology and mathematics, might just be more for getting *my* cohort unstuck - moving our self-storage (pun intended) out of private topologies and into open air, because your secrets are topological surgeries are *assertions* not *navigation*, willful overlay of surface A (source material) and surface B (the operation) from the same wholecloth, and they undo themselves when "you" come undone

the refrain: none of this has to *actually* connect if the *connection maneuver* is, itself, observable. I suppose I'm sketching a tool? a tool shaped like willingness-to-see-what-you're-going-for-along-with-you, and the tool is called "yes, and", and if there's a mathematical basis for chaining those moves while conserving sanity of the observer while building up shared topology, then... then pedagogy starts to feel *really* ready for refreshment

is it a conspiracy if no one (anatta, again) is actually doing it?
