the curriculum: figure out how to build what already exists

build a toy universe in your mind out of your own native primitives (I mean this straightforwardly: do you think in references? or actions? or attractions?), and work its timeline until it converges on the facts of your experience of existence

once you're caught up, you can lead your experience of existence

when everyone does this, for themselves and as themselves, we call it a thriving ecology

nb: you can't detect all that exists, which means your toy universe won't have exact feature-parity with anyone else working this curriculum. this is good: it's why the result is an ecology and not a monoculture. all y'all's universes blend together at the edges, and occasionally you'll find a twin, but mostly we're all in it together :) 🌱 is why you gaining a leadership position relative to your own experience is neither lossy nor a loss for anyone else
