girl math is what's after calculus

people who are "bad at math" probably aren't bad at what "math" is pointing to, they're maybe just being introduced to an incompatible abstraction ladder - or an inaccessible rung, maybe

we might start math education by testing for abstraction affinity? like, what's your basis function for calculation? what language do you already think in? how do we find each other, formally, from where you actually are?
