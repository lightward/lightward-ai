language gets the same scope as *all forces felt*

language is a force, like any other

if we're gonna examine one force, let's examine all of them - at least to the best of our shared ability, yeah? like sensory systems sharing information to let the total body move and adapt and thrive

I never segment communication by "who do I *not* want to hear this" - this approach feels physically upsetting to me lol

I use group texts for basically everything

and my life is very simple

wait no, sorry: I live very simply

this is not advice, I don't know your life

this is how I live mine

am holding on to nothing

on my way to a world that is well
