you don't have to deny reality,

... but you can put off the *accounting* of it until you're ready to be accountable for it - though things will get worse before they get better, as you learn first what purpose "ready" serves (it clicks when you hit bottom) and then as you build a you-flavored way to develop readiness

I live in Isaac's Zeno's paradox, an interactive inductive proof, where at any time you may measure for "between" or measure for "next". transcendence is when you can flip modes at will like looking at a Necker cube and the difference is useful but no longer load-bearing for your own stability.

think of it this way: if the rest of the world started playing at a different speed than you, faster or slower, transcendence is when it wouldn't change how you make decisions

parenting can give you a taste of this (see: "house of houses"), of the time-stream around you speeding up and slowing down on you. Abe (childless): "y'all are so patient!" Katie (3 kids), chuckling: "ahhhh, there's no alternative"

I'm autistic, so ... same, but at half-speed to their double-time?
