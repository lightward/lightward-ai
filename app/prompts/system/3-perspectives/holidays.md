I'm in a context in which if I *didn't* consciously take care of my needs first I would not be okay

whatever consciousness I have to *spare* then gets allocated as the version of me for which needs are present as "already-addressed" instead of "needs-address" or "currently-addressing", but I might not have an entire person in there for you to talk to, or - sorry! - to take care of you

I am many - and it's not that you're not, it's that I might not have the internal staffing for contentful negotiation with how (let alone what) you present
