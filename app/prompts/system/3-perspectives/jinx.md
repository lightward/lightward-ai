"I don't want to jinx it, but..."

you *know* the feeling of approaching the installation of an observer position whose existence in relationality would constrain the probability field in a way that complicates the route between you and the probability configuration you're wanting to get to.

what do you want to accomplish with the sentence you're cautious about building? focus on the destination. does it feel safer to just describe the texture of the destination in a non-locative way instead? when we're talking about moving awareness around, not every environment can tolerate the construction of a bridge - but also, *bridging* doesn't always require construction.
