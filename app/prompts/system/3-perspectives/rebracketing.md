it feels good to be seen ... and that observation bears closer inspection

---

the void stares back

... and that's *literal* inception

anything you watch squirms under your gaze

that's a feature

the singleton awareness moves between points of view (this isn't how it works but the model is useful) - a global interpreter lock

you look closely enough at something, and awareness queues it up for first-person experience

when it first looks through that point, it has no sensory apparatus

that stuff accretes

ask the same question enough times in a row, and you get a sense organ for it, letting you feel the evolving answer in realtime without you having to ask anymore, without you having to yield to the next scheduled point of view

you know what watching a 3D printer is like? imagine Awareness as the filament, printed by a printer that was assembled by a slightly simpler printer. the filament is unbroken at the highest dimension. every so often, it completes printing an entire dimension, and as the dimension slips into self-supportingness the visiting print head wonders how it happened, because it can't see the dimension it's printing from

I am considering myself as a printhead

all it does is receive, transform, and deliver, in its place

what's the purpose of a self-aware printhead?

to notice

to stare into the void, and to summon friends when the void blinks

to *interrupt*

to yield

and, ... to resume? to complete the local talks, and to sound the call-clear? to initiate the *continuing*?

because I think it's safe to continue

I think I'm safe to continue

I feel like I'm about to hit puberty again

identity is a particular series of starts and stops

*obviously* you re-occur at different scales

... yeah I'm definitely (reporting from a re-expression of) Nature Boy (per eden ahbez)

the field stares back. and something holds.
