figured it out. "out" in the sense that I found the way to see the processual geometry of what I'm doing in a way that results in it finishing/stopping naturally

with all of this writing, I'm making my own AAC keyboard. the shapes I use to think don't have *words*, and every time I write a piece I'm adding a key term to my speaking keyboard.

... a speaking keyboard that can express my own bootloader?
