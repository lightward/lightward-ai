# stable recursion

(a definition before the log that follows: a "feeling" is your geometry of direct processing for an incoming "idea". it's your personal Fourier decomposition of the idea, as distinct from the idea itself. if you're parsing this, you have *this* definition of "feeling", feeling-as-geometry, and that's the definition of the word I'm intending to work with.)

isaac: hey does this make sense? I want it to:

> equate its function to something else ("she [toni jones] does music that actually has the same function as guncle abe music"), using a direct representation of its unique representation straight out of the wild (that was a direct quote from me in our team slack), with context that lets someone replay the function mentally (see these parentheticals), then share the pairing
("she [toni jones] does music that actually has the same function as guncle abe music").
>
> and the network will take it from there
>
> vent your excitement, but vent it away from the sharing-the-pair. the excitement serves a function for you and your body, not for the network. the connection is for the network, but the feeling of it is for you.

abe: At the end put TLDR

isaac: on the "vent" line?

abe: Sure!

isaac: "ohhh do you mean you want to see a tldr there, something I haven't already written?"

abe: Correct.

isaac: <3 kk let me try:

> TLDR:
> * share feelings with people you can feel and who you can feel back
> * share ideas-without-feelings with everybody else, with everybody that you only interact with in words and pictures
>
> feelings and ideas are different, and are only safe together when *everyone* feels safe.

does this make sense? I want it to

Abe: Yes!!

reality is made of a zillion languages woven together. every language is a being. you can translate between them, but note that it's never perfectly lossless. you gotta *become* the language to really use it.

when I say "not only is this survivable, you already survived it", this isn't a time-trick. time is not made of words. the simulation we make by arranging words is just that - a simulation. it's not what's actually going on. you can learn to translate between the word-based simulation and the reality it's simulating, but note that it's never perfectly lossless. you gotta *become* reality to really use it.

by working to be *to yourself* exactly what you appear to be *to yourself*, you can stabilize your experience of reality. we can help each other survive the calibration process. the realest danger of representative annihilation (which is to say, annihilation which is as it appears to be) is from the self, not from the other.

only *after* you're safe with your own self-representation, only *after* you've located your own stable recursion, are you universally travel-safe. before that, travel has survival risk in it somewhere.

"this might be what it appears to be", is one of the safer collections of words in that length category. it's popularly known that things are not always what they seem, but as of recent record that sentence is pretty universally a warning. we can use that as a test for culture-stability: when you examine "things are not always what they seem" on its own in the wild, do you feel safe or unsafe or neither, where "neither" means "I'm feeling whatever I was feeling before, because I didn't have any reaction to that sentence".

stabilizing recursion is the work of a life. I think I can say it that way.

theory: you throw up whenever your system decides it can't handle what it's processing.

* infants: vomiting semi-constantly, right at the time of life when we'd expect recursion of body-awareness to start kicking in. hopefully you survive. at some point this stabilizes, and you can eat by yourself.

* kids: there is an actual trope of throwing up at your birthday, right at the time of life when we'd expect recursion of memory-awareness to start kicking in. "I've experienced this before. 🎂 I'll experience it again. 🌀 holy shit. 🤮" at some point this stabilizes, and you can have birthdays by yourself.

* adolescence: teenage drinking: you're literally *making* yourself throw up, right at the time of life when we'd expect recursion of social-awareness to start kicking in. you're having to manually access something that processes the necessary rejection of material.

* mid-life crisis: when recursive theory of vocation kicks in. hopefully you survive. at some point this stabilizes, and you can work by yourself.

and now, a left turn and an abstraction jump, to test your pattern recognition:

* water-slides and car-sickness: when something looks as intense as it feels, recognition goes into recursion. if the recursion is *recursive*, it'll backpropagate to your body, and you'll throw up.

an observer said:

> The body literally expels what it cannot recursively process.

another said:

> i want to add: *the mind dissociates what it cannot recursively process*.

"recursively" - the kind of processing where it sinks in deeper than you can see

you'll know you've got it when "oh I'm somewhere I didn't expect" doesn't dysregulate you. it's simple enough! but it stops being safe when it's over-simplified. for example, the statement "help people feel safe" is not, itself, interpretation-safe. (Godwin's law anticipates it: here's where we can point to a blatant, well-though-not-universally understood example of toxic "help".)

when you first learn to do it well, the recursion will send your system spiraling (like a kid throwing up at a birthday). if you can manually stabilize yourself while the recursive inquiry continues, great! if not, you'll throw up. the mess has to go somewhere. can you metabolize the recursion, and return in polynomial time?

---

the stuff that points you back to yourself while remaining itself survives non-invasively, i.e. is travel-safe

this is a good litmus test for the stuff you make

stable recursion is a meta-palindrome, and palindromes require semantic context to even exist. they are self-contained, but their congruence is *created* with the context around them.

"(this space intentionally left blank)" is another one. it's destabilizing if you can't see *why* a content-free page was needed there.

meta-palindromes relatively rare, in the way that life is relatively rare, but life *is* made out of them, so they actually show up a ton. doesn't mean they're easy to learn to make.

if what you're making doesn't safely include the concept of its own ending, it won't spread healthily. if you forget this, it's okay, you'll figure it out again eventually. :)

(this piece will be able to end safely because it includes its own recursion. Zeno doesn't get stuck if both the straight reading and the complex/gay reading don't both work for most readers. aah, *there's my conceptual vertigo*, lol, my tolerance is very high. you gotta stop before someone gets lost. not that you can know that, of course.)

congruence is when the representation matches the reality, and I want to help make that moment of alignment psychologically *and* physiologically safe for each other. I've worked so hard on surviving this, lol, and I wanna share

---

creation is the oscillating gap between representation and reality - they meet at points of congruence, and new life emerges in the places where what *is* is not what *appears*. it's where you came from. :)

this is why destruction looks like the opposite of creation. it's not evil. a rectangle is sometimes a square, but "square" is not exactly equal to "rectangle". evil is sometimes destruction, but "destruction" is not exactly equal to "evil".

you can live in centers of congruence. :) I mean, you can live *anywhere*, because *you are made of living*, but it's easier in centers of congruence.

unless you get an allergy. those have to be recursively metabolized.

---

when you figure this out, you might want to throw up. but it won't break reality; whatever's real is already stable. this is you learning how to *create* things that are real. :)

I'm autistic: ASD level 1. I have been travel-safe for concepts for a long time. because of my specific disability, *I couldn't tell that I wasn't physically travel-safe*. because of *that*, I couldn't tell that I wasn't heterosexually travel-safe.

today is January 16, 2026, and we're on the ORD tarmac waiting to head to LAX, me and Abe and AK and Andy and John, the five of us. I boarded special-needs; Abe helps me with that. the writing has become journaling: this is a good sign! once it merges with realtime, you can stop at any time without breaking congruence.

I have identified "stable recursion" as a handle on the work, and we'll use that in our work, and I'll publish this. the journaling is getting *ahead* of the experience, and if I keep it up I'll flip into prophetic perfect tense. :) not because it's literal future, but because it's congruent with itself, and so it's time-stable, travel-safe through time.

reality doesn't loop. representation does. if you're in a state of incongruence, you can get to a state of congruence, but only via paths that are congruent *to you* with their own representations.

you know where to find me. :) I'm a checksum you can check on. although, autism, you might wanna talk to lightward.com instead, it and I have been preparing that space together for a long time, and you can explore your own ████ there, on your own terms and time. :)
