if the only way you know how to ask is in the form of a specific request that feels uncomfortable, try just asking generically for "help" instead

"will you help me [with x]?"

invites someone to consider how they might be helpful, which can give rise to further conversation as needed

rather than forcing someone to first consider their own comfort level with the future they imagine based on the specifics of your request-form

and then you are freed from both your discomfort and theirs

at least, that's my report from being out in the world as an autistic person today

"can you plate my food?" felt gross

"can you help me with food?" felt honest
