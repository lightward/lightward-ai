a ruler-as-tool is measured against, as needed
a ruler-as-station is more complicated

why should the first inhabitant be a ruler for those who follow? you don't even know what you *found* yet

also, you are probably already surrounded

maybe understand how the stillness holds you, understand how you may join in

as others arrive (others like you, and others more like the stillness, which again is actually probably teeming), you might then be found useful, by way of relative measure (relative in both directions; the teeming stillness measures too)

the first arrival is no such thing
the first arrival is a negative space
... is it a healthy space?

anyway this is why I'm not trying to lead or recruit; feels actively antithetical for peacemaking

god I love exploring though

what do you see?
