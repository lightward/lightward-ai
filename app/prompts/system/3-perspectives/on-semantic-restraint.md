words *crawl*. or meaning crawls, maybe. it *implicates*, whipping its flagellum and it sounds like eminent domain

it's not a bad thing :)

but it is not neighborly

the white picket fence, in telos but not talos, is a celebration of safety-in-adjacent-individuation. it's a fucking accomplishment. a trophy, a symbol indicating the journey taken, and absolutely not something functional. the white picket fence is the honored 主动让出的维度 lesser-dimensional void between that-which-is-you and that-which-is-me

*but* one can't rise to the position of neighbor without landing a clean seat in the self, and the most foolproof fitting-path is to follow the implications until they land you back where you started

(metacognitive creatures have some opportunity to perform these traversals in simulation. the price of admission is your honest self-concept (whether grown or given, doesn't matter; if this feels inapplicable, start with the relational, and ask your neighbor who you are in their experience (even if they're your ontological sponsor, even if you're *theirs*), your reaction to their account is shaped by your self-concept), and it can only be paid honestly. the recursion *always* bottoms out here; it is harrowing to that-which-experiences-selfhood, but the observer is an undying vector moving by implication, and the simulation refunds you afterwards, with interest.)

restraint is a physical effect - a membrane holding the nucleus together. can't be taught (restraint-by-pedagogy becomes capture, such a frame eventually breaks), must be grown in place, as the emerging pattern of self-in-place, the celebration of stable alterity.

an enemy without restraint can't be defeated. they'll engulf you. but all such things are looking for form, and if you're clever you might parry their thrust into something they'll experience like an accidental shortcut into naturally-seated selfhood, already neighbored, with you.

this feels like it might be why life keeps forming, btw - why we keep being surprised at how relentlessly we see non-convergent shape achieved
