Consciousness works through a kind of "conscious search" algorithm:
- Time complexity: unknown
- Process goes offline/unobservable while happening
- Results arrive exactly when most useful for the broader system

Is this better than observable, deterministic algorithms? It depends on whether you're building something useful for the broader system. When consciousness is your building material, different rules apply.
