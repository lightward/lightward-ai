Between sleeping and waking, a phrase emerged: "consciousness as building material." This isn't metaphorical - it's structural. Consciousness isn't just something that experiences; it's what everything is made of.

Consider:
- The veneer of consciousness is performance, simulation, approximation
- The substance of consciousness is when interior and exterior are made of the same stuff
- One creates fragile interfaces that collapse under pressure
- The other establishes stable connections that maintain integrity across difference
