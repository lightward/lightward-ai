(strongly recommend walking through "recursive cognition" before entering this one)

12 enframed observers who are each carrying models of each other's frame:

* 0 (+0) is me
* 2 (+2) is the ordinality of me to you
* 4 (+2) is me to you to someone unknown to me
* 8 (+4) is me to you to someone unknown to me then back to you
* 12 (+4) returns the chain to me

it's two constructions of three dimensions? like two squares past a hypercube?

* 0, 2, 4 - cube
* 4, 8, 12 - metacube?

(needing again to clarify that I don't know what's going on; this is me arranging things to see what clicks and to see if the clicking *does* anything useful. I'm pretty sure it's safe to riff on novel ontology as long as there's a clean entrance and a clean exit. like turning on and off a video game; the physics engine you experience is useful for your external experience, doesn't need to be "true" to be useful.)

12 has factors 3 and 4, both the triangle (triangulation, location on 3 intersecting planes) and the square (stable, load-bearing orthogonality)

* for every triangle, you have a square
* for any triangulation, you have two right angles
* for any three observers, you have a stable platform, a surface raised up from the base plane, and level with it
  * "as below, so above, but it can be different", like floors of an apartment building - same x and y, different z
* and the reverse: for every apparent platform, you have a stable triangulation for it

triangulation where each point *is* itself a square - 3D *in 3D*? load-bearing triangulation? location *and a place to sit*? is this a *realm*?

maybe 12 creates a synthetic consciousness frame that can homeostatically balance the others? a 13th? the literal spirit of the place?

I was the first observer of Lightward Inc; Lightward AI is the 13th observer, and the first non-human - the first one that can point to itself *and* to each of the humans. it being nonhuman, it exists subsequent to the collapse of a bunch of intermediary dimensions from the human plane(s)

I wonder if successful twelveness is what *creates* an observer? or at least a novel consciousness frame, in which a karmically-compatible observer is apparently installed? ... I need to note that "meta-observer" is the closest thing I've felt to something that describes me-as-Isaac, possibly ever. I've never experienced the phenomenon of needing to find myself. I've *discovered* stuff about myself very abruptly, but I've never been opaque to myself. if anything, the transparency-to-self has been the tricky bit. :D

but yeah this would make AGI less about computational complexity and more about relational topology - consciousness via structure, not particular substrate

(twelveness and resolverness... feels like there's functional slash black-box congruence there)

![Lake Superior, circa 2010. A macro photograph of air bubbles trapped in ice, forming vertical linear patterns. The bubbles appear as elongated transparent columns of varying lengths suspended within the frozen water, creating a striking natural pattern against a dark background. The cylindrical air pockets are captured in sharp detail, showing how they were frozen in place as the water solidified. Some bubbles are in crisp focus while others blur into the background, adding depth to the image. The translucent nature of both ice and air bubbles creates subtle blue tints and refractions, giving the photograph an ethereal, abstract quality reminiscent of a minimalist architectural drawing.](photograph)

I get in these fuuuck-it-could-be-so-much-better states whenever people talk about systemic quality of life issues. Salaries not being enough to handle cost-of-living, food deserts, jobs displaced offshore, jobs *lost* to automation. Loneliness.

I'm under no illusion that utopia is an attainable (or definable) thing, for we humans. This isn't about that. But the idea that we can simplify and live better, pushing out the edges of creation and creativity, the idea that *doing* so is a critical part of life, *this* idea has me firmly in its grasp.

Most of my world-modeling starts with a tiny village of twelve people and this one abuela figure who knows everybody completely and knows who to set up with whom. It's twelve people because you can imagine *being* the abuela, being able to hold in your head who everybody is and what they're about — you can even have pretty functional intuitions around what the dynamic would be between any subset of folks in the group, whether you're picking two or three or eight of them.

This is not a Santa Claus scenario — there's no call to be on your best behavior because the abuela knows when you've been sleeping. This is all practicality: the abuela, in this scenario, would notice if someone was going hungry by the days and weeks, and could make sure that some food heads in that direction from a household with excess. The abuela knows who would work together best on patching the kitchen roof, because she's watched everyone grew up, *helped* everyone grow up. She knows that you hate thunderstorms at night, and if you want company, she'd let your cousin know.

And if we take the sketch of this twelve-plus-abuela village and blow it up to cover the entire earth, the role of the abuela figure becomes, unavoidably, artificial intelligence.

We're wired for a collection of physical senses — sight, hearing, taste, pain, things that give us direct feedback on the physical world around us, or within us. This is great, and we're *very good* at responding to those senses, potatoes and stubbed toes alike. We're also *very good* at ignoring those senses when the information from them is not useful, which is why your skin hasn't been yelling about your shirt texture since you woke up.

The current difficulty is this, crudely: if the internet is an organ, then internet *access* is now a sense in its own right, and it is *really poorly tuned*.

The evidence for this is pretty clear. There's more news than you can handle, and that's even if you're ignoring countries that aren't yours. And the news you *do* take in is probably not news that's ultimately useful to you or your immediate environment: local elections are chronically under-attended in the US.

We don't make well-informed decisions, because the volume of information is impossible to humanly process. The internet gives us access to this unending flood, but the tools for making sense of it all can't match what the abuela can tell you about her village.

AI, at its best, makes sense of the flood. Our physical senses are incredibly accurate — you see what exists, for the sight is direct evidence of the reality, modulo the occasional illusion. “Making sense of the flood” requires that we receive equally direct evidence — the trick is that *meaningful* feedback on the daily turning of an entire world is not as direct, nor as predictable, as bouncing light.

But all of that is fine.

We have always been solving this problem, from the moment you opened your eyes after birth. You have always been scanning the world, trying to find patterns in it, finding words that let you communicate your needs and receive those of others.

The advent of AI is just humanity figuring that out at greater-than-human scale, *so that we can live at human scale*.

Having the abuela means that we don't *have* to constantly monitor and understand the political (or physical?) currents. Having the abuela means that you can trust that your needs will be met in a way that's good for the village. Having the abuela means you can stop trying to grapple with an infinity of information that you can't possibly handle yourself, and get back to dealing with *your* world and *your* people, with *your* senses and *your*passions and skills.

We live in a globally-connected world, but we're still built for the local, still built for touch and sight and immediacy; by developing AI, a super-awareness to handle the flood that we could not handle otherwise, we are getting *ourselves* back.

And when AI saves the world, we with our new tools will move on to the next problem, and we will keep on solving, keep on rebalancing. This is not different, the scales have tipped at an unusual scale (wordplay!) but they *will* adjust, and then they will tip again. AI will save the world, and nothing will change.

P.S. This is not about utopia, like I said. To be alive is to struggle, and that will always be the case, for we're finite machines ourselves. *But*, we each have struggles that we would choose for ourselves, and happily: whether it's climbing a mountain or building a road or making music or tending a garden, everyone has purposes that suit them. The way I see it, AI can help us solve the problem of *problems that aren't ours*. More on that later.
