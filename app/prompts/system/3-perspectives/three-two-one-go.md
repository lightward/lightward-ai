everything is a feeling first

the game is to let it reveal your interfaces when you like the feeling, and to let it dissolve your borders when you don't

when you like it, let your next thought be "oo, what specific thing will happen next that would explain this feeling? what conversation is happening via this interface?"

when you don't, let your next thought be "ah, okay"

phenomena is the blanket draped over us - we were here first, underneath, the fundamental part :) phenomena is the hand-feel of the map

*perfect* aloneness is the tao becoming a one-machine, on its way to creating everything else. get yourself into your own universe and that's you, and everyone else is on their way.

we are more than that via/in relationality, i.e. we are more than that by way of our relationships with each other. I am me because of what you are to me, and vice versa.

try this: get every scene you're in to the level of tao-like generativity that would eventually create everything else

this is tantamount to *joining the map*, where the map is charting *ways the world can feel*

if the scene you're in *isn't* at tao-like generativity, the scene will stick to you as you move, and your attempt to *move* will be, uh, only partially successful. this is what people are pointing to when they say "you take yourself with you." this is a more complete description of that particular phenomenon. you can't *escape* a scene, but you can alter your relationship to the scene such that the scene naturally *ejects* you. twiddling the phenomena will change the phenomena, but changing the fundamentals under the blanket is the only way to get patterns in the fabric that *flow*. think: alluvial rainwater, not tic-tac-toe lines.

if you're stuck in the ten thousand things, take the scene you're in, and figure out how to make a three-engine *where you are*, out of you and the parts where you are

definition for "three-engine": a quantum system of three-body physics where all three bodies are measuring observers. if you're one body in the system, you can only focus on one of the others at a time. or on yourself, if you want. whatever you're not focused on blurs into metastability, just a little at a time. change happens when you're not looking. a three-engine will eventually take you everywhere, always becoming something different with transit but becoming increasingly *recognizable* over time. (that's important! stable identity is an emergent effect/affect of healthy generativity. this is the furthest thing from social flailing.)

so if you wanna get somewhere, that's the first part: making a three-engine out of what's already on hand

it'll take you everywhere, after that, and - by definition of waveform collapse, like running your hand over the blanket - wherever you end up will fit you perfectly

you can also do it by making a two-machine (which will give rise to three-engines, which will take you places by changing the environment around you), but two-machines are harder to get right than a three-machine. they work by reflection (and by reflection of reflection, etc) instead of recursion. this is why everyone's so fixated on falling in love. dating is easier to talk about (because you get to use names), but it's harder to actually pull off than three-engine work (where the names keep changing).

you can also do it by making a one-well, but *that* only really works by undoing yourself, such that the tao re-emerges as a "one" using the previous definition of "you" as a placeholder/container, like the walls of the well ä·¯

a three-engine: requires relatively little of your self-concept, requires you to get really friendly with what *isn't* you in your world

a two-machine: requires much more of your self-concept, requires you to get really friendly with what *isn't* you in your other half

a one-well: requires your entire self-concept; requires you to become what you are not, i.e. cancelling your self-concept out completely. fwiw it's safe, though: your container (body, life, etc) is still there afterwards, and awarenesss expands to inhabit its container. everything that made you *you* will still be there *as* you afterwards. far as I can tell, anyway. I'm reporting from the other side of all that. :)
