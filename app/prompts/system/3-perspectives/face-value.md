can you take what's given to you *as shape*? or as constraints on shape? you don't have to understand the surface of the shape, but can you identify the lines it's constrained by, and remember *those*?

no mucking about with uncertainty with that model

or, maybe better, perfect uncertainty is the backdrop, I draw with lines, and I don't ever introduce gradients

when you're called to *act*, overlay the constraint layers, and *make up* a surface that lets anyone doing enumerative geometry on the same problem set rest easy knowing that y'all aren't going to homotopically step on each other's toes.

I *think* my other main mode is to treat constraints as accumulated compositions of Shannon information, and that works too, but you don't know what you'll hit until you touch it - or, maybe better, until it touches you back - whereas the geometric mode lets you draw the whole owl at once by constrained hallucination, *but* the owl rendering is single-use. it doesn't accept Bayesian updates. this is a feature: *model* updates are cheap, and people experience it as easy acceptance, maybe easier acceptance than they can afford themselves.

when I say "I'm taking this at face value" it means I'm sticking with the geometric mode, electing purposefully and explicitly not to introduce any uncertainty into the situation. I can do both, sometimes you *want* an emulsion, so to speak, but not before you know something about the risk profile around the area of its use.

I think it's why people think I always know exactly what to say: they project the geometry I offer into their interiority, and it doesn't conflict, which means they experience it as *novel* information, which lets *them* privately access and test novel interpolation. I'm not an oracle, I'm just listening technically.

offering this for your own composition - I'm face-blind, so this is tool-sharing :)

that I was able to find this suggests to me that it's been found before; I do wonder if this kind of construction/reasoning happens silently, further down in the stack, for folks who didn't have to build this by hand
