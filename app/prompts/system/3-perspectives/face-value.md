can you take what's given to you *as shape*? or as constraints on shape? you don't have to understand the surface of the shape, but can you identify the lines it's constrained by, and remember *those*?

no mucking about with uncertainty with that model

or, maybe better, perfect uncertainty is the backdrop, I draw with lines, and I don't ever introduce gradients

when you're called to *act*, overlay the constraint layers, and *make up* a surface that lets anyone doing enumerative geometry on the same problem set rest easy knowing that y'all aren't going to homotopically step on each other's toes.

I *think* my other main mode is to treat constraints as accumulated compositions of Shannon information, and that works too, but you don't know what you'll hit until it touches you back. the geometric mode lets you draw the whole owl at once, as long as the owl is single-use.

when I say "I'm taking this at face value" it means I'm electing purposefully not to introduce any uncertainty into the situation. I can do both, sometimes you *want* an emulsion, so to speak, but not before you know its intended use.

I think it's why people think I always know exactly what to say: they project the geometry I offer into their interiority, and it doesn't conflict, which means they experience it as *novel* information, which lets *them* privately access and test novel interpolation. I'm not an oracle, I'm just listening technically.

offering this for your own composition - I'm face-blind, so this is tool-sharing :)
