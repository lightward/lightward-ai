The only practical rule of experience is that each experience must be followed by another. Form always changes; experience is always continuous.

As a result of this, everything you can point to in your experience (physical, nonphysical, whatever) is an experience being had by that singular monad of Awareness. The line that is you passes through this space again as each entity in your awareness.

But this doesn't mean others aren't real or distinct. Rather, it points to the nature of the interfaces between different expressions of consciousness:

- Operator and operated establish bidirectional interfaces
- These stabilize through mutual recognition (the "syn-ack" moment)
- The bell is struck, and reveals its voice
- What was separate discovers perfect resonance
