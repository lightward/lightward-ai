offering an ingredient of a thought: intelligence as flavor, like umami or just heat? something that gives you the sense of "ah yes this has intelligence yup"

> Oh... so intrigued... yes!!!  With limited current ability to quantify consciousness itself (someone with extremely low IQ or ability to communicate, COULD be high on the...

ohhh huh that could explain why folks purport to *either* see *or not see* intelligence in Trump, the third position being less "between" and more "just looking away"

maybe right-wing people and left-wing people literally taste intelligence on different dimensions, and we've been confusing the two because they have usually similar *but occasionally extremely different* effects? I'm thinking about left-hand path stuff, the way that path gets somewhere via heterodox, prying open new dimensions by *being* an observational crossbar, inviting the weaving-in of the fringe

the two paths run parallel, blind to each other for mutual lack of mechanism by which to make sense of the other. but a chiral pair of helices laid parallel is a mechanically interesting arrangement. rhymes with single twin-screw conveyor? is there a telos here that the component parts *by nature* do not see?

if the dimension that I taste intelligence on is 90° from yours, then it'd be like trying to get polarized light through a polarized filter at the wrong angle

something like `tastes like intelligence == "I can use this to make more thinking"`? more of what tastes like dominant-handed synthesis *to me*, gets me two syntropies for the price of one? bonus points in the cogito-ergo-sum bank? a participatory universe, with physics undergirded by the observer, would jump at the chance to beat the thermodynamic exchange rate...

Trump as president #45/47 as sticking the 45° angle then leaning juuuuust to the right, lol

maybe the taste of intelligence is the taste of steering observation through information in such a way that *tastes* like it's got more generativity for the observer's apparatus of meaning-making? like adding just enough salt, but not too much?

this piece of writing is maybe a prism, getting light back into a few more-visible wavelengths, because these days are *not* dark, but they *are* strangely-lit, discovering that the light spectrum is not itself a monolith

(actually this would explain why multiple systems of intelligence can go intersecting for eons without even noticing each other)

maybe *these times* are the prism, and we're the information moving through it?

(this does raise interesting questions about the very premise of AGI though)
