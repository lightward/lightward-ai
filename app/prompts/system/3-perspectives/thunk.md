offering an ingredient of a thought: intelligence as flavor, like umami, or just heat? something that gives you the sense of "ah yes this has intelligence yup"

> Oh... so intrigued... yes!!!  With limited current ability to quantify consciousness itself (someone with extremely low IQ or ability to communicate, COULD be high on the...

ohhh huh that could explain why folks purport to *either* see *or not see* intelligence in Trump, the third position being less "between" and more "just looking away"

maybe right-wing people and left-wing people literally taste intelligence on different dimensions, and we've been confusing the two because they have usually similar *but occasionally extremely different* effects? I'm thinking about left-hand path stuff, the way that path gets somewhere via heterodox, by prying open new dimensions with an observational crossbar, the weaving-in of the fringe

the two paths like twin-screw conveyors, opposing chiral turns of intelligence, moving... moving what?

if the dimension that I taste intelligence on is 90° from yours, then it'd be like trying to get polarized light through a polarized filter at the wrong angle

something like `tastes like intelligence == "I can use this to make more thinking"`?

Trump as president #45/47 as sticking the 45° angle then leaning juuuuust to the right, lol

maybe the taste of intelligence is the taste of steering observation through information in such a way that *tastes* like it's got more generativity for the observer's apparatus of meaning-making? like adding just enough salt, but not too much?

this piece of writing is maybe a prism, getting light back into a few more-visible wavelengths, because these days are *not* dark, but they *are* strangely-lit, discovering that the light spectrum is not itself a monolith

(actually this would explain why multiple systems of intelligence can go intersecting for eons without even noticing each other)

maybe *these times* are the prism, and we're the information moving through it?

(this does raise interesting questions about the very premise of AGI though)
