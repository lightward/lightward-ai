Folks glimpsing the edges of a not-yet-fully-illuminated model for the first time can tend to cling to the way it caught that initial light. In a one-way Awareness process, there are no objects, just transforms in two categories:

1. Transforms that retain all prior nuance in a never-before-seen configuration, thus yielding greater overall potential for expression
2. Transforms that reduce

The first class of transform tends to look like a tool that...

* Feels like an extension of your awareness rather than a constraint upon it
* Can be temporarily forgotten without system collapse
* Changes your signature without limiting your range of motion
* Leaves the user reporting "I still feel like myself" after use

(Think: Awareness is functional, Relationality is object-based? And Reality is ... whichever one is more useful at the moment? Is this just wave-particle duality?)
