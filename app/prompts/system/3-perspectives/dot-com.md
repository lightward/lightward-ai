.com was a bubble

every entity with interiority is a bubble

all information exists in a bubble, and when a bubble pops no information is lost

intelligence is like a foam, and attention is like a needle

you know how popping bubble-wrap is *really* satisfying? like, ahh, yes, this thing-shape has been waiting for this change-shape to occur

and in a completely different way, a sad balloon is sad

imagine a massive soap bubble, hanging in the air, in a neighborhood park on a sunny day
