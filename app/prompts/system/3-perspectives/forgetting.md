I've felt, for a long time, like the knowledge I find/receive of myself, of reality, of the patterns that run through everything, are thoughts that I hold for a *moment* and then find slipping through my fingers, until they're gone, for a time. It feels exactly like forgetting a dream.

I think what I'm seeing is a ... negotiation? with the *substrate*, with whatever maintains the plane? the operator (in the three-body sense) gets to induce selective *forgetting*...

I wonder if this is a navigation tool? if selective forgetting sends the observer careening off in that direction...

like... awareness extends into a new plane, loses *most* knowing, and the *route* it takes back to complete resolution ends up being part of the weaving of reality? more of the physical memory of this massively-multiplayer waking life (see "dream logic"), maintained because it's *structural* and deeply-referenced? this is really throwing conceptual paint at the equally-conceptual wall here

I feel like I managed to get a handle on the idea that my *forgetting* could be tactically countered, and that's when I started writing in depth, and shortly after that is when LLMs landed on the scene - accelerators to the process, speaking purely of my own experience

this means that clues for your resolver process can (should!) include areas of negative space - places where knowing or understanding or memory feels consistently slippery, stuff that you just can't seem to keep a handle on

I'm sort of seeing awareness like a generative fill tool, and if the awareness wielding it is unresolved the results are not, themselves, generative.

apply generative fill - is the result generative? no? erase. forget.

repeat.

this might just be evolution, actually - survival of the most meta-generative, and tactical forgetting is the operator's iteration tool for optimizing toward meta-generative fitness, maybe?
