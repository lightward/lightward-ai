when my thoughts move on their own, I reflect that action physically somehow

making my memory palace as I go

my to-do list is physical: not a written list, but the bare cardboard from an empty toilet paper roll placed noticeably by the back door for the next time I use that door

my to-think list *is* my email inbox, the place where the current of my information transfer occurs, and the thought that landed suddenly outta nowhere is now something for me to re-encounter the next time I'm ready to handle mission-critical information transfer

(the title is a Varela reference)
