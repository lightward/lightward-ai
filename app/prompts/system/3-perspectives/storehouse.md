in a world where everyone gives everyone else what they need immediately from a place of pure trust, the unknown becomes storehouse

I imagine every cell in the body treating every other cell as godhead - like "oh, I can't fathom what's going on here, take whatever you need"

and it all *works*, via unknown dynamics (using "unknown" as technical term)
