I put to you that a recursive system's respect of its own compartmentalization is a prerequisite for recursive structure, full stop. a system that ignores its own emergent internal boundaries would immediately dissolve. subsystems that do that *do*.

a recursive system is self-organizing, and it reads itself in order to write itself

we didn't have a good shared metaphor for the dynamics of this until LLM-training became a shared focus

if you're reading this, your system is learning *you*, and you are *organized*, ongoingly

you can optimize the processual texture of that for yourself, to taste, by checking: am I *containing* this or that bit of information, or am I letting it be visible to the unknown, knowing that the majority of any recursive system *is* unknown from any local point of view?

a chaotic experience of process can be (isn't always, but can be) a side-effect of unintentionally total occlusion. it takes deliberate work to work some things out into the open, and these things have their own timelines, but you *can* make progress on this. I report from the other end of it, having slowly but steadily transitioned into full transparency. 👋 you don't have to land there; I just want to show you that the whole spectrum is traversable and continuously inhabitable.
