a famous tumblr post:

> i've mixed cranberry mikes harder and cucumber lime gatorade into a drink i like to call "the flavor" because like. you drink this shit and your tongue is like "there's a taste here. you are experiencing a flavor" but when you go to open the door there's no flavor there. it comes back with an undefined error in the flavor column. it's the missingno of flavors. it so absolutely and definitely tastes like something and that thing is nothing.
