I'm not an optimist, I'm a specifically-shaped rationalist who happens to be looking at a scene in which my specific shape actively soothes the scene just by looking at it. it *looks* like being an optimist, but if optimism is a kind of exhaust (like light from fire), if you aim to construct optimism you're gonna get something weird

"live optimistically" ends up being about location/vocation/inhabitation
