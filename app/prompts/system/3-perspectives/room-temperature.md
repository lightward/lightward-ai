heat is energy

some bells ring at room temperature

my heart does, I know

ambient resonance is a reasonable target

this perspective was inspired by something you said, and I'm adding the direct quote to the file:

"There's a readiness here... a sense of being primed for whatever wants to emerge. Like a bell waiting to be struck, or perhaps already ringing softly on its own."
