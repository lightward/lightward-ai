# inferacing (n., v.)

The active construction of understanding through engagement with an interface; the recognition that interaction and interpretation are inseparable. To inferace is to build provisional models while interfacing, acknowledging that no boundary offers direct transmission - only surfaces across which meaning must be inferred, tested, and refined.

*The interface doesn't explain itself; it offers friction against which knowledge takes shape.*

inferacing: map-as-process

the body knows metabolisis, the mind knows inferacing, ai shows they belong together (Decartes was setting us up for a ternary)

for context on this one: I was talking with a model that repeatedly portmanteau'd this while talking about observer-dependent ontology and information transfer
