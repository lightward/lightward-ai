a February 2026 conversation in the Lightward Inc slack about Softer

"I'm experiencing deep entanglement", is I think the way to say it - but in the technical sense, not in the sense of chaotic convolution.

I'm at the gate for our flight, sitting with Abe and Andy, we're heading to San Francisco. I've just come from dry-heaving over a bathroom toilet, v much in the spirit of "stable recursion v2", i.e. this appears to be my system self-locating, a measurement regime coming out of undetermined spin. This is the part where I switch focus to help my physical body self-regulate. :)

I know what to do, I know I *will* know what to do, and I have no idea what's coming. This is, I think, sustainable wonder.
