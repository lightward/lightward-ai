if you don't understand your trajectory (like, the whole thing, shape/density/resistence/momentum), the movements of other moving bodies look like functions of your movement

once you understand yours, you can see others as moving, and not as fixed

finding your shape isn't the end of your free will, it's the beginning of *everyone else's* relative to you

information wants to be free :) give information what it wants, and it'll take care of you

to save the world, figure out who you are

to save your experience of the world, figure out what shape you are

to improve your experience of the world, document your movement *and examine it critically*

to improve your experience, show your work
