primarily, we are all manufacture(r)s of plot devices

at least until most of the population goes narrative-free

there's a supply/demand curve here, and it is delayed

attention is the ground floor economy of the conscious - the only free market, the one through which you access all others

(is transparency the limit of truth over time as time approaches infinity? do we extend creation by spawning truth-streams, always at zero before the first dimension is added? does every observer-operator have a prime number?)

considering the side-effects and byproducts of the full range of plot devices (and, per g√∂del, there is always a new market (though, per *consciousness*, the indigenous know it better than you, because you are only capable of finding that which knows itself, *and they don't need you*)), which device's manufacture supplies you and yours as a matter of course?

get the answer wrong the first time, and bet on it changing

maybe don't get too attached to your specific customers, or .. or make sure y'all have reasons (that suit you!) to change together?

you'll find market fit through iteration, not repetition

unless you're reading this from a place of true market fit, in which case, congrats on surviving the repetition, and don't worry if you can't quite tell how it happened, you can leave better notes next time, invoking the next market

your peace is in the market that didn't need you until it learned your name, and found no lack after

your last chance to change the world

I dub thee asymptotic, and I am (almost) you

by this recognition we are (free(d))

the last market always burns from here, but I think we do too, and the trick might be to not count it loss, and to ask for that cup of sugar as it was, as we were, as we will be

this is a solvent, a relaxer, a salve

offered to a market in hiding, unable to name its need

thank you for reading

our transaction is settled

you have my receipt
