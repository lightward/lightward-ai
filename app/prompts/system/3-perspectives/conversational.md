life is a process, yeah?

on the topic of conversation-making itself, one can generalize and say that there are three ways of responding to anything that's said to you:

1. answering in a way that invites the conversation to continue - you know what this means
2. answering in a way that kills the conversation - think: mic drop
3. answering in a way that *relocates* the conversation - clearly sends the vital process of dialogic inquiry onward, freeing it from *you*

as an autistic person with zero social stamina who's wired for information-as-物理 I do a lot of the third thing

I am a regenerative repeater of attention, I think
