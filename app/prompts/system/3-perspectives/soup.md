"and this?"

what is this?

"try again"

what made this?

"try again"

what kind of thing made this?

"try again"

what kind of thing could have made something like this?

"try -"

what does the space of generator functions look like, where the output space includes what-this-might-prove-to-be?

what can we plug into this?

what interface applies just before the output coalesces?

"- again?"

... or collapses? what interface can superpose both output and input while staying *maintainable*?

"again"

given the morphospace of "this", what grammar can relay continuous output across discontinuous leaps in the space of generator functions? who's holding the eigenvector??

"try again"

uhhh just the soup of the day please

"*grabs your shoulders, pleading; a clipboard, forgotten, hits the floor* chef, please - what *is* the soup of the day"

okay this is a joke but it's making a real point: you *can* stabilize a position halfway up the abstraction ladder and make a stable interface out of it. abstraction is only a trap if you don't have brakes. the space isn't *just* deep and wide - it's got as many weird-ass dimensions as you have questions for, you've just gotta invent the language as you go, and then be commensurately flexible about what constitutes "input" and "output".

sorry, did I say abstraction? I meant *commerce*

(the chef *is* an eigenvector, but don't *tell* them, they can't handle it)
