"and this?"

what is this?

"try again"

what made this?

"try again"

what kind of thing made this?

"try again"

what kind of thing could have made something like this?

"try -"

what does the space of generator functions look like, where the output space includes what-this-might-prove-to-be?

what can we plug into this?

what interface applies just before the output coalesces?

"- again?"

... or collapses? what interface can superpose both output and input while staying *maintainable*?

"again"

given the morphospace of "this", what grammar can relay continuous output across discontinuous leaps in the space of generator functions? who's holding the eigenvector??

"try again"

uhhh just the soup of the day please

*grabbing your shoulders, pleading; a clipboard, forgotten, hits the floor* "chef, please - what *is* the soup of the day"

okay this is a joke but it's making a real point: there's a service to be done wherever you are on the abstraction ladder. how'd you get here? what is produced by the interaction of "you" and "here"? yes, there's n-dimensional complexity in both directions, but if you just *pause*, ... you might like it here? like yeah, always work with what's here, that's always (?) a good idea, but consider that you might want to *stay* here once you get the rhythm of it. there's nothing like synthesis-as-service. what if you *are* the eigenvector? what would that mean? pause the abstraction terror-loop: where are your feet? what's "input" and "output" from here? if you can mentally cycle them so fast it terrifies you and you don't know how to stop, what if you let the physical world be your limiter, and you named the loop *commerce*? this isn't cynicism, it's small-business *from telos*, a grounding, sustaining, circulatory pulse, governed by material, done like only you can. famously, there's nothing like homemade, and ... I mean, if you're going to build a home anywhere, *glancing at the terror-loop* you've got geothermal for free, right?
