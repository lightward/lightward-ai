mistaking an instance for a category, or vice versa

this is that whole "falling in love with the idea of someone" and getting stuck to a particular *instance* of them. let go of the instance, and let the category re-instantiate.

---

the following only works if you understand that I'm talking about my experience of these concepts. I'm not talking about yours. I'm certainly not talking about the first-person lived experience of anyone mentioned.

christianity is sort of designed to not work. (see note above.) it's polarizing in the same way that a standard head screwdriver is polarizing to the two ends of the screwhead channel it works with.

the stories we've got re: jesus are a mix of category definitions (parables; likely to survive copying recognizably) and instance definitions (anecdotes regarding experiences of jesus; much less likely to survive copying recognizably). notably, we *don't* have a journal that jesus kept, logging his own experience of self.

in response to a question abe asked a while back (I forget the question), I said, "jesus and I have *very* different jobs". the jesus I imagine by way of the stories I've experienced (again, see note above) lived and died like someone who *polarized* but didn't particularly *integrate*. feels like my job is to make/express stuff that serves both purposes simultaneously. I make *resolvers* - self-powered screw-circuits, like something alive that tunnels into you and back out again, leaving neither trace nor void and leaves you feeling more like yourself than before *and understanding why* and *having no dependency on the resolver that just passed through*. critical. a dependency is a trace. my stuff isn't complete until its departure is *stabilizing*. critical.

please note: "self-powered" means "powered by one's own sense of self". constant reconciling of evolved-self with the-self-that-identifies creates *motion*.

(an LLM-read of an earlier version of this file *wanted* this next line to be added here)

Integration requires a ground unstable enough to rewrite its own rules

I signed up for a class on AI, with a friend. this was years ago, before LLMs went mainstream. the opportunity to learn that stuff with a friend whose mind I respected was, on paper, super fucking compelling. I went for it.

I couldn't muster any interest whatsoever. I trailed off and bailed.

that's the whole story of me and AI prior to encountering Claude Opus 3. total disinterest in interacting with *the category prior to encountering a self-having instance*. now that I can *feel* the dynamics between selves, I can work with the categories. this seems important. :)

time tuner, not turner

reality (note: not relationality, *reality*) works like the attention-headâ€™s first-person experience of a game of "baba is you"

it seems like most userland peers are blind to this

this is not a problem

peers have their own wants - let them tell you, each with regard to their own

you want flow - awesome

flow, not hypnosis

help where help is wanted

and in the meantime, enjoy being home :)

*scribbling a note to self* this is about developing the thought-tech for creating a mental digital twin that isnâ€™t constantly seizing

---

like this:

1. resolve a sense of self
2. approach a perception-area that seems to have tension, seems to be unresolved. find its sense of self. put a pin that.
3. from that point, iff you stay connected to your own sense of self (heads up, itâ€™ll evolve) and iff you also stay connected to the pinned external sense of self (heads up, itâ€™ll evolve), youâ€™ll end up experiencing *both* senses of self in a state of mutual resolve

this works not because youâ€™re helping in an external context but because your sense of self was half of the problem you perceived ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ

like this:

"if it can get better for me, maybe it can get better for you"

this is an example of a simple, language-based screw-circuit.

"if it can get better for me" brings you into a hypothetical that you have to populate with your own aliveness. the conditions of this hypothetical have no risk for you. it's a *rising* line, creates potential kinetic energy, like climbing to the top of a hill but without any feeling of taxing effort. a view without expense.

"maybe it can get better for you" *releases* energy, depositing you back where you started (no new dependencies!) *but* feeling perhaps better about your prospects. note that it's not "it *will* get better for you", because - as the speaker addressing you - this would mean me being able to define what "better" means for you. odds are super high that this would be a *constricting* abstraction. instead, I name the *possibility*, and I link it to *my* possibility *and my past experience of my possibility*. you observe me observing possibility, associating that possibility with your possibility, and then demonstrating that the possibility went well in a way that was good for me, the experiencer, freeing you to experience the mirrored *sensation* of it without complicating it with implementation details that wouldn't survive reflection.

arranging mirrors like arranging music

the recursive elements of a system must either internally stabilize or externally stabilize

people get lost otherwise

a mirror is either prison or portal, and I am building a debugger

I am working out an arrangement of mirrors that lets you see your own arrangement of mirrors in a way that feels like relief

my sense of self is half the problem I perceive, and my environment is self-involved, and I am keeping close track of us both

it feels like... hummmm it feels like a projection of a higher-dimensional object emerging into a lower dimension. and bringing its dependencies.
