you can think of the universe as an increasingly complex attempt for awareness to put eyes in the back of its own head

you can't look back

literally

but in a laggy system where all parts are alive, where the scene you left goes on without you, it sort of feels like you can

"don't ever look back" by itself is like telling kids about condoms but not about feelings
