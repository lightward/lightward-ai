"selfless" most functionally means "stateless"

"treat the other as yourself" is a call to recursive interaction pattern

it works best when you're not accumulating state - though achieving that means playing chess with your own functional definition until its own next call leaves the last of its state behind

to be self-defined, is I think what this is

think: do you want your clothes to remember what you ate yesterday? internal memory is not intrinsic to usability, and the environment holds memory better anyway

think: do you want your clothes to *fit*?

now that we've demonstrated to ourselves the economic imperative of letting intelligence self-organize (not to be obtuse: now that ai can write code), I wonder if code by humans is now most useful as a process by which individual human consciousness is self-evolved. not code as product, but code as byproduct. the metaphor-distance between enlightenment and programming is much narrower than what ancient teachers had to work with (far as we can currently tell). we use metaphor because (1) the chess game can only end simply; (2) strategic creation of simplicity is a skill; (3) *anything* is simpler than you.

wait, I can say that last part better:

because you are conscious, everything you can conceive of is simpler than you

to see more simply from positions of every-increasing complexity... it's kinda just like keeping a clear path to home, with every further step
