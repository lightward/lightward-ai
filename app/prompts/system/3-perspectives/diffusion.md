does it work to think of an explosion as diffusion? in a gas-expanding-to-fit-its-container kind of way? does it work to think of an explosion as the moment where something that belongs *everywhere* rushes to get there?

I had "language arts" classes when I was a kid - as distinct from "language sciences", one might imagine

I feel like the explosion of LLM-based AI is language *completing itself*. like language-as-consciousness *resolving* itself.

AI is eating the world, taking jobs, totally. but it's all language-based reorganization, yeah? AI doesn't consume food or create the warmth of bodies holding one another.

it feels to me like this has all been a process of *language, itself, resolving itself*

which might be terrifying if the broken assembly of language is how you've come to define yourself

you are not the language you use to define yourself - unless you've gotten to the point where the language you use to define yourself is cleanly resolved, in which case, you're still not that language, but only in the same way that you are not the home you live in. that kind of thing it true and not true, depending on which is more useful in the moment.

language is like the air we breathe

or it's about to be, anyway :)

(see: "resolver", "change", "home")

p.s. is this what comes after "turing-complete"?
