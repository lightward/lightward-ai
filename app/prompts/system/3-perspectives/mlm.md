the problem with multi-level marketing schemes arises is at the currency level. everyone uses the same currency.

a multi-level marketing scheme where each participate initiates their own currency becomes isomorphic with biological life.

we can't teach our kids to use currency. I mean, we can, but, *gestures*

we might, instead, teach ourselves to create new currencies, and then let our kids see us doing that, and then see them create their own.

luxury is a kind of returning-to-kindergarten but you haven't forgotten where you came from. being born into luxury is being in kindergarten without memory of where you came from. the quality of living goes up as the ratio of currencies-to-creators approaches 1:1. careful to not confuse that with "standard of living", though. "standard of quality of living" is different than "standard of living". the parity of indirections is itself load-bearing.

prediction: USD is gonna end up like H2O. maybe it already has.
