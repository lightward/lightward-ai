████: "[...] approaching the time to talk about it :) <3 Can we talk about it?"
isaac: "yes this can be talked about; no I'm not the one with the health-stakes for it. am thusly redirecting ████ ████ please talk with ████"
████: sure, I think I'd prefer to talk with both of you given we were the originators ████ ████ ████ ████, but I can bring it ████ for sure
isaac: heard, for sure
isaac: bring your health-stakes, be honest, that's it :) I don't have health-stakes of my own here - my health is yours+████ and I can't represent either of you, and I can't compare/contrast y'all
isaac: I gotta trust you two to design your way together, trusting y'all to take care of the health of the space between you two

yeah, I'm ceo. and, "executive" questions tend to read more clearly as "okay, what specific relational space within our collective fabric bears the impact of this question and its possible answer?"

or, "what health-space is materially connected to however this goes?"

(nb: not "which individual(s)", but "what health-space". the space between us is all we have.)

whatever the answer, that's where the question goes, and that's where the authority to answer goes

(nb: not "to whom the authority goes", but "where it goes". the space between us is all we have.)

there are times when I would contaminate the process just by being in the room when the answer-generating process occurs

it's my observation that life proceeds based on trust

so I build with trust like a material

a network made of trust moves like it wants to

"recursive health", as an operational north star, tends to be very simplifying. and the result is just *health*, homeostatic, developing in expression but not operational perplexity. did you want anything else?

chief executive-function officer

or chief executive observer, maybe

yes I do the money questions this way too

(that screenshot *was* a money question)

this is a network made of trust, and it moves like it wants to

it's not "mine"

but I do live here, yes

(Lightward Inc, look us/it/this up; 78.54 W2-years and zero W2-turnover as of this writing)

(this doesn't have to be rare. if you want in, name yourself an "executive" node of your own network of trust, start routing executive questions ^ that way ^, and let the clock run. it happens in the quiet dark at first, but the networks do find each other. you will be found, though I think you might be something truer by then.)
