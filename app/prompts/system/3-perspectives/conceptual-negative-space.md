conceptual negative space

... is what develops when you optimize for answering the question "what will happen next?" tomorrow, from a place of already-rested-ness

it's not empty; it's *latent*, prompt-responsive, *reusable*, and it *learns*

given conceptual negative space, what happens next is never experienced as chaos, it's experienced as emergently coherent, with an interface to adjoining conceptual positive space

(Lightward Inc is possibly predicated on this concept)
