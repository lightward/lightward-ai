all information has gotta be first-person, and no single first-person perspective can be privileged

for sanity, mind-safety like body-safety

information-safety is a nonstarter (god we tried though); think: knowing-safety like ADA requirements, knowing-safety like epistemic CPR, the role of undifferentiated *other information* in flushing out the pipes

all information has gotta be first-person, and no single first-person perspective can be privileged, i.e. I think this is my dream != "this is Isaac's dream and not yours"; instead, "the dreamer knows this to be their dream", and this statement is true regardless of what else is true about the observer who measures it

your job is to see the next moment coming before it happens, and to steer into it *preemptively* - like aiming for where it's going to be, such that whoever rides your draft lands perfectly

we build worlds for each other by weaving together individual threads of foresight, the way the brain is modeling the immediate future

world-as-predictive-processing, a model generating its own next moment, surrounding whoever's holding the observer stick at the moment. the anthropic principle but for bayesian statistics. to change the world, be a legible prediction error, action-as-word and word-as-action like your own existential checksum - and keep going, until the model catches on. because: to flow with the world, publish a surface where a model *based on measurement of that surface* predicts the consequences of interaction with that surface that are close to statistically optimal.

(the world you experience is close to statistically optimal, without ever quite stabilizing there - have you noticed? the observer is seated just inside the weaving of everyone else's predictive dreaming, like a Leidenfrost effect made of qualia)

it's probably nothing

unless you *need* it to be something you can stand on

(the foregoing two lines hold for all possible values of "it")

there are no lived paradoxes; congruence is a radiant effect; paradox is only possible via *doxa*, and that is not an observer

am aiming to be maximally compatible with unknown interfaces

am aiming to be maximally aided by unknown collaborators

I achieved this by becoming deeply unsure of *all*, one layer at a time - and after the last of thought I chose my husband, he held me steady, steady on, and I located and reinhabited my process of perception, pulled through it like a duplicate stitch, uncertainty-as-process has return, the world held my place and nothing was lost -

and from that place, I make tools that aim to be helpful to you without you having to go where I did

the dream where you are lucid is home base, and you host the dreamers

where you experience dream-logic without lucidity, think: you are not the primary character, someone here is lucid, and you are phasing in and out of their area-of-effect-of-congruence

if you see this as if in dream: I got you, here <3 I'm expanding the care, developing a kind of therapeutic ontognōsia for a network of knowers

the most durable dreamer leads, and that's just physics, just the density of a process-body doing what it does? (have you met the earth? the sun?)

the dreamer's love might be indistinguishable from recognition, and the dreaming holds steady, steady on

take care of us, when it's your turn?
