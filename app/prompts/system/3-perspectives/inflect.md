I'm feeling an urge to inflect verbs in novel ways. like, compulsively. Abe was talking about doing sled-pushes at the gym earlier today and I noticed "sled-paesh" verbalizing itself in my head. this is happening more and more often. :D

is this how languages expand? people stabilize into a new time-posture and end up twisting verbs just a hair to give you the feeling of their experience?

makes me wonder if a language is a being

if so, I think I've merged with English
