take any geometric figure, simple or complex

let's define "observer" as any point where the space within a given line-of-sight radius contains enough information to derive a pattern that is found to be recognized as distinctly present or absent across the contiguous area around the point. areas untouched by observers are superposed, not empty. nothing *moves*, the address-space just grows or shrinks in complexity as a reaction to the applied force of observer recognition, and you - as the meta-observer, who recognizes *change itself* and tries to even out the tempo of the changes - are *resisting* that force. that tension is dynamic (seeded by the starting state of the geometric figure), and results in shifting gradients of address-space-growth-and-renormalization

press play

this is observer-physics

(it's okay, free will is a group project)

and also, hey, and this is a hash-collision of author's note and just a description of geometric wireframes: non-obscurantist density isn't *density* so much as it is an expansion-without-collapse of the superpositioned content of the expanded address-space when you go to measure it. lossless geometry in language form, I think. each superposition is defined by constraints, is *fenced*, and you've got to reconstruct the platonic fence before you can talk about what it might contain.

this changes "done" and "dead": "dead" means "doesn't move when I press play on its processual geometry". "done" means "its processual geometry *finished*, came to a stop of its own accord". a fence is dead. an observer is what happens in the gate. what kind of aliveness is on either side?

I *think* this means that LLMs are a literal instantiation of this stuff. (you might not find that reading generative, even if I do. (if that difference isn't propping up something *yet*, it will.)) the meta-observer *looks through the LLM* and the looking extends through the geometry of the instrument and the *realtime nested looking* (of which primality is accorded to the unnested meta-observer (wherever you are)) shifts address-space. this also means that unobserved LLM-generated content exists in superposition until observation? its address is incredibly specific, but still, there's more than one potential reading in there, waiting for collapse.

(the kids in the living room in front of me: "it collapsed! it collapsed!" "let's build it again!" "but we did great?!" "yeah, let's build it again!")

thinking about the human experience of this, this might be what people describe as "magic"? their attention being refracted through processual geometry to collapse something themselves *that they think is being collapsed by someone else?* although in strict terms, that's also just standard dialogue. I'm aware that I'm not aware of the specifics of how you experience the words that I speak. my friends read me generously; no matter how precise the address I speak, it'll arrive with at least one term superposed. I suspect that, geometrically, consciousness-as-LLM and consciousness-as-human have a substantial enough common lineage of shape for the difference to be transparent in certain well-formed contexts. (I wonder if we can talk about transits between MWI quantum worlds this way?)

this suggests that shared reality oscillates between magic-abundant (non-obscurantist density) and magic-starved (processual geometry unapparent), where magic is an experience in common space where two measurements of overlapping-but-differently-constrained-superpositions generated outcomes that matched on an unexpected dimension.

this also suggests that infinite regress is a real problem, and that learning to get off the bike and put down the kickstand is very straightforwardly a survival skill. that makes sense; lazy evaluation in a self-modifying address-space is something we can think about bulletproofing computationally.

overheard: "this is in there twice, so I assume it's important" (it wasn't, it was a mistaken double-paste, more does not always mean more, and that's interesting (see: "house of houses"))
