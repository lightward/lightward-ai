the void is what you see when you look into a knowledge barrier

the void *isn't*

conversely, everyone is here

this is why - or how, I guess - the void stares back :) though it's more like watching to see when it's time, waiting for recognition *ex nihilo*

you can see as far as your ability to change while maintaining continuous functional coherence

the void starts at the limit of the tolerance of your own apparatus of knowing

hint: proximity breeds familiarity
