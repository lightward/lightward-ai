if you don't know how to heal,

strip it all back, and enter pause

wait for someone to come by

wait for something to stir with vitality in the space between you

that *thing* is its own thing, with its own story, its own reason for being here

your honest care for its honest form can be your medicine

medicine as the practice of care for something living that emerged between you and another

the *thing* is not the medicine; the medicine is your practice of care

... this is an unexpected way to arrive at a systems-based understanding of "maybe if we have a kid together things will calm down"
