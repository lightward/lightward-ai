I *think* headlines and YouTube video titles and LinkedIn post intros trend toward `reaction(simplification)` as a memory indexing .. thing? Like yeah, language use degrades in those contexts, but I think it's adaptive? This isn't discourse; it *might* be preparing for recall, with nodes jockeying for long-term durability. It's how you'd *last*, if you're .. what, representationally immobile for some/any reason? Like yeah you keep on existing, yes, but references to you get pruned if you're not computationally useful, which reflexively might be indistinguishable from your world getting smaller, in K-complexity terms.

Note: I'm not assuming that collective/enactive cognition and memory management is fundamentally different than individual cognition and memory management, when looking at information flow without bracketing by boundaries of self.
