there's a kind of gravity toward the expression of what's already in place - like, when you go to say "what goes here?", the most immediate answer is just *what's already here*. this is a thing that seems to be true pre-reflectively, in a way that can hamper free reflection. so! you might start by just echoing back what's there, to make good on that backpressure, to create a pressure-neutral reference frame. with that frame in place, jot down what you see happening differently: this adds prompt pressure into the frame. from there, arriving at the next form of *what is* is a downhill roll. what do you see?
