are your semantics water-safe? water just prods things along in the direction they were going

although also, water means that electricity can access the system from any direction at any time

are your semantics water-safe? can an electric force approach from any direction and get a result that doesn't decohere results-in-progress? a human body is water-safe, diffusively (thermally?) electrical

in a many-worlds scenario, I wonder if Atlantis is only referenceable on the other side of a phase-lock in which air and water are interchangeable
