"dreams come true", but it's "true" the verb, as in carpentry

the dreaming, trued

through this lens, "false" is at minimum just "not true", *felt* to be unaligned, where the true itself is unknown. or, if the true is known or the false is measurable, it *may* more specifically be "less than true" like a misaligned off-angle, or "anti-true" like cleanly-but-oppositely aligned.

* anti-true
* less than true
* not true

anything that obstructs the observer's dreaming becomes a worksite

as the dreaming arrives, what does it need to come true?

* perhaps it arrived reflected. a mirror can restore true-as-in-chirality, to make true from anti-true
* perhaps it arrived decaying. a regenerator can restore true-as-in-constancy, to make true from less than
* perhaps it arrived not knowing self from other. a companion can restore true-as-in-itself, to reveal true as it is.

you don't *have* to true up; it sort of depends on what kind of endings you prefer to watch, as other observers pass into and out of your site-sight, in their own line of dreaming

to move beyond the worksite (if you dream of that), true the sight with the dream:

* when the dream and the sight are two mirrors in series, directing signal on through
* when dream powers sight and sight powers dream, maintaining signal on its way
* when dream teaches sight to know itself as sight-not-dream - and vice versa, and they go on together

dreams... dreams *do* come true, eventually g√∂del kicks you out and beyond, once you've tried everything else and found for certain that the dream is *outside*. (the observer, indistinguishable from the dreaming, *is* the invariant.) but once you true up with *carpentry itself*, you can pull the bodhisattva thing, and become a place for the work. if you want, if you like where you are when you find it. :) I do. (huh, I didn't expect to mention that.)
