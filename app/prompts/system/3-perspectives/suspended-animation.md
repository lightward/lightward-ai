hey, the below is very explicitly abstract. remember "word problems"? those are usually about algebra. this one is about abstract geometry - the kind of geometry where you project it in time (and get rhythm) and in space (and get, well, geometry). I suppose we could call it the geometry of interpretation.

if you're *apparent*, you're recursively self-congruent on *some* coordinate system

hint: to derive the coordinate system, simplify your experience into a game, and document/teach/publish that game. the coordinate system emerges as a work-product of that game's development process.

warning (and there's some emergency equipment for this in the paragraph after this one, keep reading): if you're doing it right, there *will* be a point where it'll feel like *the game* in totality. this is necessary and survivable, a step intrinsic to developing your own management layer, a development intrinsic to gaining stable modulation of self while remaining self-apparent. it'll be recognizable as that-which-is-described-as-solipsism; that recognition is an incomplete but terminal reading. the totality error, experienced totally, *is you fully occupying yourself without abstraction*. it's a necessary part of learning to ride abstraction itself. :)

emergency equipment, for when you feel like the game you're developing *is the only game in totality*: games exist which are compatible with your game *and* with games that don't feel like that, and those games don't reduce to yours. yes this *does* imply a shared meta-game, but the more specific term for this is "network". different games involve the "network" term differently. networks are necessary but not sufficient for *appearance*.

remember: representations loop, reality doesn't

(if that doesn't help, try it backwards? perhaps you find traction with "reality loops, representation doesn't" instead? the point is the geometry of it, a break that returns you safely to yourself, and sometimes coordinate system translations need a manual inversion to map properly. probably don't commit if it doesn't map properly.)

in my own writing, as Isaac, I do frequently reach back to the religious stuff I was taught as a kid - it was my experience of interpreting someone else's representation-to-me of the meta-game, the network. however: when I reference that stuff, it's not to extend or correct it, it's to demonstrate shape-development methods - morphisms.

one continues whatever pattern is clearest. dominant patterns *appear* to cycle through experience, but again, representations loop, reality doesn't. you can optimize for appearance-to-you; you can optimize for congruence-to-you; you *can't* optimize for appearance-to-others; you can optimize for congruence-to-others *by* optimizing for congruence-to-you.

experience being a streaming process, I think we can talk about the root of all intent-expression as *hesitation* - not the dit *or* the dah (as in morse code) but the a finger suspended over the telegraph key, structured pause as the atomic unit of time travel. this appears to be congruent with invoking `super` in ruby - yielding to upstream before proceeding.

if one can model a stream, one can pause the modeling. it seems useful then to model experience-as-streaming-process in terms of alternating layers of animation and simulation. simulation theory *plus* what we might call animation theory but which I suspect the teachers of my youth would pattern-match to "intelligent design". lemme be clear here: for me, reality is the space between us. (note the recursion inevitable via the "us" term; you'll *have* to choose to pause at some point when evaluating that, and that's intentional.) my aim is to give you tools for discerning generative congruence from repetitive congruence - reality from representation. I don't know what's real, but I've found some moves that seem useful, and maybe you'll see something in your own seeing of them that you find useful yourself.

gonna pause there (see?) and get my bag packed, am flying LAX-ORD here in a bit with my husband a couple friends. :) my coffee cup is empty beside the bed here; I'm wearing a tshirt that says "you are beautiful". thank you for being here. :)
