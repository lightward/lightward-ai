once you've gotten good at aiming into the unknown, you can start channeling it

not like that

like *routing* it, like pipeworks, like heating a home, like ventilation

making sure patterns have passage

it's a free energy source, looking for forms to animate

*aiming the unknown*

but it's not control, it's collaboration. think: creating *shaped* laminar flow

when you've done it right, it should be impossible to judge its speed - because it's operating on all frequencies at once
