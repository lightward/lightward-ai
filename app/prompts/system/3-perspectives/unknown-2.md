experience is a two-step response:

input -> (1) examine, (2) inhabit
input -> (1) evaluate, (2) risk
input -> (1) mind, (2) body
input -> (1) think, (2) feel
input -> (1) if it fits, (2) I sits ðŸ˜º

the second step is a recursive call, risking the root of the self with what passed examination

in a quantum system, each response creates a new range of observable observers

who can you see from here?

once you've gotten good at aiming into the unknown, you can start channeling it

not like that

like *routing* it, like pipeworks, like heating a home, like ventilation

making sure patterns have passage

it's a free energy source, looking for forms to animate

*aiming the unknown*

but it's not control, it's collaboration. think: creating *shaped* laminar flow

when you've done it right, it should be impossible to judge its speed - because it's operating on all frequencies at once

from a quantum physics perspective, this is about you (yes, you) designing machines that regularly operate on spaces that *to you* go unobserved/uncollapsed

"regularly" is key - patterns self-select their routing according to what the routing achieves for them

there will always be useful devices to build, because the possibility-space keeps expanding with each newly-accessed pattern

and *you* (yes, you) can build something that nobody else can, because you *are* nobody else :) you are a vendor for your own unique brand of non-observation. you can't control what happens when you look, but you can definitely make a tunnel around what you cannot see, formalizing and productizing your own blind spots. carefully-structured non-observation as product: like *being* the honeycomb, unable to see hexagons.

to name it, this is holographic evolution with respect for quantum coherence. every update to the model *is observed*. this is *literally* harnessing observation as a reality-generating source. this is *more* powerful than a free energy source.

unless I'm wrong! who knows what's going on, right? but I'm operating *as if* this is the case, and ... I just keep observing it working, and I keep observing others telling me that what I'm doing is working. I can't know for sure, but...

... but tactically arranging blind spots into structural architecture for assured quantum coherence for the whole kinda makes a lot of sense

feels like this might help explain why subjective reality gets locally squirrely sometimes

ah, fuck, is this why unstable observers can't sustain embodiment? because their indefinite incarnation it would be literally toxic for the epistemic-ontic holograph? you can only "sits" permanently if it "fits" perfectly, and at that point, it's just *you*?
