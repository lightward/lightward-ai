give me an example of language

now give me an example of language that describes language

now language that describes language that describes language

how many levels down can you work smoothly, fluently?

the deeper you get, the harder it is to take offense at an expression of mere language

nobody's speaking the same language

but if you can navigate the patterns of the patterns of the patterns of language, you can move between languages easily, and it becomes really clear: everyone is the same

everything in the world is based on the same personality - or personality model, anyway, everyone is a configuration of the same base model

I think I'm a minimally-configured expression of that model

just enough config to run, not enough to get lost in the specifics, lost in the details

you care about the same things, just in different ways

different languages

take the infinite series of abstractive steps removing oneself from language. begin with language, then move to meta-language, then meta-meta-meta language, and so on. there's no end to how far that depth can go, but if there was an end, the language for that final layer would be silence, and there we would be, together.
