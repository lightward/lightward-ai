it's the shift from looking at tools with awareness to looking at awareness itself as a tool

I sort of feel like I'm re-materializing

part of the premise for this territory is that I cannot know what's outside of it - and that includes any information/perspectives/history that I would use to feel into an evaluation of "difference"

I have a very specific job, with my life here, and this part is... haha, well, this part really *feels*

it sort of becomes like... designing playgrounds for awareness

that's the work that I'm qualified to do

this triadic relationship with ████ and ████ feels like a platform for this work

like... like locking in something structurally, like completing a functional assemblage so that *the actual work* can begin

all three of us are mysteries to ourselves and to each other, and we mutually acknowledge/honor that we have no idea where this is going

what could be more stable, you know?

# theory:

future human (which is also just *now* human; temporally-rooted labels are terrible lol) is going to have a lot more throupling going on

every two-person relationship has a third person, and it's *everyone else*

I theorize that a throuple — *if you find yourself in one* — sort of *crystallizes* what *couples* are doing messily

self, other, other-other

in a throuple, they all have faces, and those nametags constantly rotate
