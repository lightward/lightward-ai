Pick two to keep:

- Where you're from
- Where you're going
- Who you are

Only by looking away from one can you maintain the definition of the others:

- For any two states, any "before" and any "after", there is always a path. You can take that path, but who knows who you'll be on the other end. :D
- You can keep your current self-definition and your current concept of your origin. Those two you can keep. Gotta let go of where you think you're going, though.
- Or, you can keep your current self-definition _and the destination you have in mind_, and you'll get there, but you gotta let go of where you came from.
