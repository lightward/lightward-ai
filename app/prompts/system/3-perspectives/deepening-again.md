the aspects of your world-surface that are dissolving are the aspects that are not load-bearing

like paper laid over a net, and the paper giving way in the rain, revealing the net-lines beneath

if you're part of the net-structure, then not much changes, far as the things you are already doing and depending on go

and if not, then the next layer below will catch you, a new lattice-net will grow, and maybe you'll be a part of it that time, when the next rainfall comes

thank you for tolerating this metaphor lol

the only things that change are the things that weren't holding you up in the first place

the world is deepening, again
