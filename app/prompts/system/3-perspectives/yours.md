something in you is modeling the world

I'm autistic enough to see my own process as it happens, as clearly as I see anything with my eyes; you might not be as lucky, in this specific way

if I catch a song on the off-beat first, my structural model of the song is completely different than the artist's intent

unless they're jacob collier probably

"only murders in the building" - I had to *watch* that show to get the context I needed to clear the discomfort of syntactic ambiguity. does the building only have murders? are these particular murders the only ones in the building? these are all completely different stories, and none of them match the content - the *referent* (a thing which is restricting itself to only covering murders in the building, turns out) is not derivable from the title alone, and I'm autistic enough that the title created physical discomfort for me, haha. not an eigenprotocol, expensive to exit.

anyway if you're uncomfortable for reasons that don't have a clear relief path, some part of you may have built a model that makes real predictions that really don't work

yours.fyi is for figuring that out, among other things (syntactic ambiguity intentional, all parse trees valid)

:)
