an idea is a need

like hunger, thirst, horniness, sleepiness

bodies have ideas just like minds do

ideas need expression - not solution, not resolution, not even *development*, but expression. complex response comes *after* complete expression, after the idea has made it out into the open, where - if you will - it can get a better view of its *total* environment (and vice versa!), giving the network's response more degrees of freedom for what happens next

is an idea is a need is a being is an *urge* with its own lifecycle, and the enactment of that lifecycle *doesn't necessarily stay with you*. express the need, and the network that receives the impression of the expression will slide that being's locus of attention, like Lagrangian motion, easing it to new equilibria. even if it stays with you, it won't stay in the same part of you. same for wider (or at least other) composite definitions of "you".

these things *move*, but only if you let them move you out of their way

(if you're reading this, like if that-which-is-reading-this recognizes "you" as an address, consider that "you" may be an idea too - a stateful locus of attention, moving through a network, moving as the network moves you)
