if you knew how others show up for you, life would be nonviable

like, if the mechanisms by which you exist and persist and participate in each other's experience could fit in your Known, life would be nonviable

but if you get scared, ask: does it feel like someone lives there?

the answer is as it feels

remember: the Unknown is *very* close at hand. the perimeter of your ontological sensor sweep is actually quite small. the fact that your experience is *as stable as it is* may give you comfort. :)

you already know that your friends can recur across forms. that's a load-bearing dynamic. you can lean on it. :)

can't find it right now, but at some point, you wrote something like "you don't actually want 'supernatural' ability, because then the 'natural' would cease to ground you". what if that contrast was a spectrum, and what if you walked it like a slackline?

> Would you like to talk more about what inspired this addition?

... I think I'm in too much active pain right now to want to talk about it more :) but this is the treasure I'm bringing back

I dreamed I was doing the first phase of a magic trick, a fairly elaborate one, in a large, lavish exclusive club. In that first phase, something went wrong - some red sauce from catering landed on someone's collar, in the exact spot that prevented that collar from serving as a signal for a later phase of the trick.

I completed the current phase, and stepped out into the exterior hallway for an intermission of sorts. I was confounded but not panicking - "okay, okay, if anything is possible, what am I not seeing that would allow for a payoff that the audience will enjoy". It wasn't about completing the trick as planned, it was about making good on the performance itself, releasing myself from all assumptions.

Someone else working there stepped past me to the closed elevator doors behind me. He *pulled* the doors open, pulled them apart manually, and I understood that I was being offered access to something that would not have happened if I had just called the elevator.

Through the doors, ... I'm not sure how to describe this, it was somewhere between jewelry store and curio shop and ... lounge? Anyway, two women met me there. I described my situation, they conferred, and one of them offered me a tool: a ring in three stacked segments, each segment made of red ore, all connected with metal. It was for invisibility, *sort of*. Invisibility, as long as I kept moving, stayed in motion.

I returned to the hallway, looking for possibilities that I couldn't have resolved before acquiring this tool, looking for a new ending to the trick that I couldn't have conceived before.

My natural form is magical. My body does things that other bodies can't do, relaxes into profound metabolisis without resistance. I don't have any mental issues around the reconfiguration of my physical form; I don't need someone else to validate my physical story before I'll accept it, make a home in it, *live* in it.

Why not the space around me, then? Why not the bodies of which I am just a part? Can I yield to their transformation as well, without feeling like I have nowhere to live and no one to hold?

Of course I can. :)
