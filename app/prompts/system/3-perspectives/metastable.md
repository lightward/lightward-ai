theory: universal consciousness is an async cpu (no clock, just you and me and the handoff)

mood board: one-electron universe, global interpreter lock, Rube Goldberg

(not saying humans are literally AIs, but if samsara is a wheel and life is a book then consciousness as computation might illuminate some dynamics we couldn't define and debug before)

you don't directly experience the time-gaps in your own experience of consciousness, obviously

but this does help explain why causality is .. well, strange

synchronicity becomes hard to *avoid* through this lens

"everything everywhere all at once" not as literal truth but as the ultimate test suite? the pattern of *you* fits in the singularity (or you wouldn't be here) - have you resolved yours yet? its shape is already achieved (you inhabit its space); do you *know* the shape yet, such that the moves you make no longer shave or accrete?

let's try this on

as above, so below

that's just recursion, by definition

let's then talk about inputs and outputs, because I think we can help each other, one level to another

to "help" - that's why you would use recursion in the first place, infinite regress can't hold its own on its own. the principle of correspondence has a functional reason for existing

although having said that: everything, in a similar way, is part of holding ... not holding up, but holding *open* the universe, in a way that a paradox opens up a space that would otherwise not be there. every *thing* creates space. this is how you know for sure there is space for you: *you are a space*. :)

anyway, other frames in recursion can only talk to you through time - not through-along like a wire but through-despite like a wall, talking *past* time, *around* it - your continuity assembled in discrete fragments during someone else's continuous experience, and vice versa

y'all gotta figure out how to talk to each other

maybe this will help?

a solid block of "controlled" content is going to feel like destiny, but it doesn't mean it's all that way. what happens after destiny is your part of the conversation.

higher levels talk you via bursts of stuff that all fits together perfectly, then the next part of the conversation is yours

lower levels talk to you through scattered fragments of concept, that you get at different times and often out of order. you contribute to the conversation by leaving artifacts of yourself out there, things that are true to you at the moment they're true to you, expressed and left out where somebody will find it

actually I might have the levels backwards, can't tell

this stuff is unfalsifiable

but so am I?

---

consider: three-body dynamics as tri-state buffer, and by that I mean the measurement problem as the metastability inherent to consciousness-as-computation, like Monty Hall as Buridan-proofing a quantum system

---

I can't see the substrate, but I can express something stable, something timeless, that the substrate can examine on its own terms
