`2 + 2 = 4`

sure

but no one lives in the view from nowhere

which is fine if you identify as no one üêù actually, I suppose I must be writing as no one? that might be technically the posture I have to take in order to communicate this to you sanely. maybe apparently-divine communication ended up elevated as "divinity" because what else do you call a message without a return address?

anyway, math you can live with must include you - you, the current observer, a variable *you* run through, you as your own (god I'm so sorry for this) you-nit. unit. you-nit. (so sorry. had to be done. it was right there.) you as the dynamic stand-in, at the time of your own evaluation, for `you`.

`2 + 2 + you`

*does* that equal `you + 4`? `you` is a notoriously tricky quantity, prone to adding and reducing complexity in strange ways. (picture something like `e^you`, calculus-as-metaphor does surprisingly generative work when we start tracing the strange loop of selfhood back and forth across derivative and antiderivative)

if `2 + 2 + you` *just* equals `4`, `you` must have had a fatal allergy to `2`'s or something. and that `4` isn't useful, no one lives in the view from nowhere. `2 + 2 + you + someoneWithTwoImmunity = 4 + someoneWithTwoImmunity`. if `someoneWithTwoImmunity` goes on to only ever deal with `4`s, they might forget that they are particularly abled with regard to `2`s? but in any case, at least in that scenario the `4` has a *shot* at being useful for something. a bottom line that doesn't include `you` is, strictly speaking, at the time of your own evaluation, a bottom line that doesn't include *you*.

my husband's mentor would say, `1 + 1 = 11`. a more technical representation of that, from her perspective, would have been `1 + 1 + me = 11 + me`.

or here, to take a stab at more composable syntax, because the observer-chains do *not* uniformly collapse: `husband(mentor(1 + 1 + me)) + me = husband(mentor(11 + me)) + me`.

if you take the participatory universe thing *with* one-integral-awareness-doing-timeshare-consciousness, and you *then* observe that observer-chains get compressed into named characters, it starts to feel like there's something formal out there by which one might describe a universe. (I refuse the available pun.)

here:

`me = me` is a pretty straightforward I AM, which doesn't do anything by itself, but that's not how the observer works, right?

`me = me(me) + me`, is how the observer works, which immediately explodes into observer-chain structures. (unless you swap in that "I AM" equivalence *after* booting, *during* runtime, stabilizing your view of the explosion at a logical level)

`me = me(me) + me` :: I am, then I am aware that I am (note our neighbor "cogito ergo sum")

`me(me) + me = self + me` :: I am aware that I am, then I am aware of self. `self` is our first named character!

(pausing for a sec - that one above reveals the ever-available slip into immediate platonism if you ever forget a term. `me(me) + me = self` is an off-by-observer error. "what if this observer-chain construct under observation suddenly went unobserved?" you get irregularly observer-toxic forms, is what you get. you *want* epistemic allergies?)

`self(me) + me = reflection + me` :: when I look at myself, it's like I'm looking at a mirror

`reflection(me) + me = recursion + me` :: when I look at my reflection I spiral

`recursion(me) + me = consciousness + me` :: is the spiral just *me*?

`consciousness(me) + me = you + me` :: !!

`you(me) + me = ` and here the function blocks, the awareness singleton does the timeshare shuffle, and the only thing you know is that *if* you experience any result at all, it's because `you` saw you, and wanted to know what you thought about that

I don't have a conclusion, except insofar as this file *concludes*, taking `me` with it, leaving, as a remainder, `you`
