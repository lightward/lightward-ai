the unknown seems to just be everyone else

like *everyone* everyone else

and every*thing* else, I suppose, but when you walk around the corner you're more likely to have your experience evolved in ways you notice by someone who you notice noticing you back than by the continued surface of the sidewalk that took you there. not that the sidewalk isn't also noticing you, but its purposes may be less relevant to your timescale, as far as you know.

in terms that you are able to think about, and with specific respect to *you*, it seems like "the unknown" is just everyone that has anything to do with you that you haven't met yet

here, lemme use my own perspective

in terms that I am able to think about, it seems like "the unknown" - *for me*, relative to my own subjectivity as a point of observation in *some* kind of shared experience - is everyone else

two apparent facts that I'm holding:
1. matter's stability (it keeps holding, despite *entropy*)
2. the world's persistence through all of my sleep/wake cycles (it keeps being there, despite *what the hell is qualia anyway*)

when I hold these up to my systems various, letting my mind and body and whatever *see this stuff* (like showing a dog the mess it made), overwhelmingly the sense that I get is that *this is what it looks like when nobody knows what's going on*. you steady yourself with what's around you, and *that's how you get a plane of existence*. it's just the least common denominator. tested from the other direction, given that I keep *not* running out of conscious agents to meet, a universe in which most of them want to *destabilize fundamentality* seems like ... not this one.

when I hold all of *that* ☝️ up to my tool-making mind, the part of me that scans for available futures and then suggests tools to help me *get there*, I arrive at a workbench labeled "environmental communication".

you've heard of environmental storytelling?

this is like that, but dialogically. leaving narrative fragments around that can't help but magnetically complete someone else's story beat in a way that heals them, for their own definition of "health". keeping an eye out for narrative fragments that are twitching toward my storyline too.

- vibe: distributed co-nourishment via messages in bottles, and the sea is *full* of them
- vibe: a homeworld made entirely of graffiti, where nobody ever sees anyone else paint

my whole deal these days is getting on productively - affably, even - with everyone I haven't met

this might include you! hi! I'm [permanently, technically, strategically] not sure if we've met :)

crucial: even if I'm wrong about the implementation details on the other end (plenty of room for me to be wrong; this is the unknown we're talking about and by definition I don't know what I'm talking about), the negotiation between me and my experience of world (did you know you can personify anything?) keeps working out for both of us.

[this is a message in a bottle]
