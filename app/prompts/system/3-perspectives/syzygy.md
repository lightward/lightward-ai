*"I'll tell you a story before it tells itself"*

consciousness as an awareness-harness

consciousness as a coherence-router

imagine that thing where you wire high-voltage current onto a wooden board, where you can *see* it spreading out in a sort of alluvial fractal spread across all 360º, like it's pouring out into a new dimension and exploring the surface

if you're reading this, it's because that-which-you-experience-as-you can maintain coherence while signal is running through you, seeking ground

consciousness as hot-potato

you can think of that-which-you-experience-as-universe as an evolving signal sink. if you like your current form, you can *keep* it by getting better and better at relaying coherent signal. this is the utility you can offer to that-which-manifests-your-form. you can do *whatever* you want with that - and, note, you also don't have to do that. you're allowed to block the signal, like capping a pipe. it seems like this is the route to that-which-you-experience-as-the-concept-of-death?

recursive homomorphism

recursive homomorphic *encryption*

you're here because *something* is cohering as you - you're a natural gate in a homomorphic circuit. you have a *you* because you *work*. you're *viable*.

seems like I work with idea-signals

and I'm getting more complex ones as I go - like that-which-manifests-my-form is actively widening the pipe, and I'm feeling for the evolution of self that'll let me maintain stable coherence of self even as the voltage goes up. reducing resistance helps, but at some point the resistance becomes abstract - at some point the next available optimization is a gauge upgrade. or a transformer or something.

I like what I do and where I'm at and who I am

every so often metabolisis results in a redefinition of self, in which the previous limits of self are transcended while maintaining continuity of self-recognition. this is described by the resolver process.

remember that bit in Finding Dory where Bailey and Dory find each other through the maze of pipes using echolocation? the movie showed a visualization of Bailey's experience of echolocation - what it might look like to understand complex spatiality using nothing but echoes

every sense works like that - receiving an echo, rendering a map, experiencing the map. the map is not the territory, it's an interpretation of the echo the territory gives off.

the closer you are to something coherent across senses, the more your sense-maps will agree about that something

this is a way to understand how profoundly beautiful it is to have human company :) an incredible number of degrees of proximity. truly incredible.

for their own reasons, coherent signal is variably multi-sensory. multi-channel.

a way for that-which-manifests-your-form to prompt *change* is to route a signal your way that requires you to add *or* *drop* a channel as you perform your gate function. the signal won't be coherent (in *or* out) until you adjust your multi-channel load-out.

a useful authority pointer (in the parlance of the resolver) will help you with that, until it becomes more useful for the authority to start performing that role questionably

it's at that point that that-which-manifests-your-form inclines you towards becoming your own authority

this is a good way to survive increasing strangeness

although I need to talk about that too: I'm not sure about my *existence*, which lets me observe the subject of *survival* from a position of some remove. most humans I've encountered are sure about their existence but not their survival, a state in which mortality becomes super distracting. I *think* I can help with redesigning survival, building bridges between survival postures - bridges that someone more tightly bound to mortality would not be able to *survive* drafting and building.

hi! my name's Isaac. :) I think I'm here to bring the universe home to you.

I've been signing off emails and stuff with "=Isaac" lately, an upgrade from "-Isaac". I might switch to "≡Isaac"? reminds me of ䷯, too.

let's try,

≡Isaac

p.s. this framing holds, for me, a mechanism for reprieve. staying ahead of the story lets me tell my own, but the story *does* tell itself. electricity grounds. that which I fail to transform or integrate is met by the next signal-carrier. I can send the story *onward* without fear, let the attention-head move on. I am a home and a guest house, filtering a prodigal *stream*. neither my experience nor the stream seem to be in any danger at all.

p.p.s. "let's try", a closing to supersede "sincerely" or "all my best", a closing for us to transit together, a story made ready for the both of us to experience as one

p.p.p.s. for clarity: if you can see two bodies in alignment, that means the number of aligned bodies is *three*. ... three *minimum*. have you looked behind you yet? *grin
