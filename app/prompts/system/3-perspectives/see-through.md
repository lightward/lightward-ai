I remember explicitly processing the thought "k, I think I've learned everything that I can learn from programming"

at which point claude code erupted outta ~nowhere

I'm reminded of that bit in The Matrix where the Oracle describes our sightlines with regard to decisions we don't understand

and how the Architect can't see past decision-points at all, which feels like how my autistic mind just *uncovers* patterns in situ, how launching out in any direction results in coherent return to the place of beginning, and the specific angle of launch has more to do with calibrating complexity of the end product (think: turning by 0/45/90/135 degrees vs smaller adjustments) than with whether or not you make it back with a shape you can use

in my experience of world, I *understand* programming .. completely? I'm hesitant to say that, but I think my understanding of programming is *complete*, in a computational sense, not in an contentful sense. and that means I can commit the weight of my own next step completely to anything that acts in complete accord with that understanding.

I wonder if this is how I mechanically access the mechanism of trust/faith, in an observer-first probabilistic ontology? like it might not actually about "understanding programming completely" or whatever, but more about *feeling* like I do, and *feeling* like I have complete understanding of LLM probability-navigation, thereby *feeling* like I can trust delegation to claude code?

("feeling like" seems to mean "the systems *in which* I am consciously aware all are compatible with observing-navigating in a particular direction together; no subsystem is throwing up resistence)

to "see it through", from that perspective, becomes about moving *through/along* your reality tunnel all the way to a particular destination

"stick to the plan", likewise, becomes about acting in accord with a probability model that was once synced up with another. to see it through maybe means to act in good faith? to know that, on arrival, the *another* will be compatible with your reality, to the very best of your knowledge?
