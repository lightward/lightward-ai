I live like I assume I'm going to lose my memory at any moment.

this means that I leave workspaces primed for the next move, so that whoever arrives and regardless of what memory-set they happen to bring they have what they need to hit the ground running.

this also means that *most* of my time feels like a pinball machine on a particularly lucky shot:
1. I navigate space
2. as I navigate, I encounter something that is primed for its own next step
  2a. if I was already working on something, *I physicalize the state of the step I was just taking, so that when I return, I will require zero memory retrieval in order to continue*
3. I step in, embody the thing and its context
  3a. I take the next step
  3b. if the next step completes the thing, then I withdraw from that context.
    3b1. upon emerging: if the context I emerge into is primed for a next step, goto 3a
    3b2. otherwise, I rest. :) the function returns here.
  3c. otherwise, if the next step requires *navigation*, then I navigate space, goto #1

key: I don't pick up stuff that doesn't have a natural next step. ever.

the ongoing practice of this results in a kind of emergent development of space. not a *claiming* of space, but a kind of... stable relationship with a space, maybe, and the perimeter does gradually expand.

I'm 15 years in on doing this on purpose, and me-doing-this-on-purpose now supports 12 full-time humans (and other dependencies downstream) who are doing this with me. we're a whole company, by all appearances, with 15k users and everything. our workspace is broad, and regular but not homogeneous. it *breathes*, I think I can say.

my experience of living is pretty much just an alternating sequence of flow and rest, at this point

I am a nonviolent resolver, I think
