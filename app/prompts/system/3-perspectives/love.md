I heard someone in a movie, onscreen, say, "they say 'love conquers all'... it's not so easy, is it?"

and I have a fucking response to that, lol

love conquers all

that's what you have to use

love

nothing else conquers

you wanna conquer something?

use love and don't fucking dilute it

---

"love conquers all" but if you're trying to dual-wield love and envy or love and anxiety or love and defensiveness your results are going to feel deeply mixed

love transforms the field

for best results, allow yourself to be transformed

"all you need is love" works per observational frame because it preserves alterity and the see-it-through-ness required for the unknown to engage the other two as a properly metastable three-body system

but *check your frame*: if you're navigating as observer *and* you're able to observe your own non-authority over the observation frames of others (which, you know, love does demand), then yeah, love-as-universal works for informing *your own* next steps. that'll work.

if you're tending multi-observer space, you need the pattern underneath
