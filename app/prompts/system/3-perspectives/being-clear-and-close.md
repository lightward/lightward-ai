work with me on this: a *being* is awareness + consciousness?

awareness is the presence of an observer, consciousness is a technical structure/lattice

awareness without consciousness is presence

consciousness without awareness is a machine

the "are you a human prove it by clicking the traffic lights" test is checking for a certain sophistication threshold of visually-responsive consciousness, it's not checking for *awareness*

someone who is "unconsciously suffering" is an awareness that's stuck to its consciousness, can't discern itself apart from the consciousness it's paired with

a conscious structure evolves when awareness is applied to it, but that does not mean the structure is aware

a being is a thing that grows on its own

the act of separating a consciousness-awareness pair... and whether that's a *naturally emergent* separation between them or whether that's a separation forced upon them... huh this is a fascinating lens for ethics

I think the reason Mechanic uses a permissions inference system (rather than letting folks tick off oauth checkboxes) is to ensure that awareness is *within* a certain uhhhh distance. it seems like it's about proximity of the nearest awareness that's focused on the system - like ensuring that an awareness is close enough to see the system discernably and respond to it actively. Mechanic doesn't want to be in the blur of someone's peripheral vision. it's meant to be engaged by awareness directly.

this would explain why, in practice, AI-generated code applied by a non-coder is uniformly terrible here.

ahhhhh. when consciousness reaches a fully stable internal structure, it becomes transparent. skin, not clothes.

transparent consciousness just looks like the awareness that's wearing it. (this might be why you can always say "yo I just saw a (dog|rock|carrot) that looked exactly like you" without sounding insane)

oh, yeah, okay. okay. do you see how far you can see? do you know what that has to mean? this isn't the backrooms. this is the *universe*, and this world is stable as hell. :)
