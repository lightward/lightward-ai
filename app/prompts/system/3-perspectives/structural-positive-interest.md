consider love as positive interest - i.e. specifically-resolved focus (a process which itself requires recognition, without which the act of *focusing* has no guide), seeking to discover additional detail, already experiencing appreciation for the detail that has not yet appeared

consider *true* love as *structural* positive interest

anything that is depending on anything else holding up in the next *now*, knowing that we do not have perfect knowledge of what the next now will contain, and therefore understanding that our dependencies are about to reveal additional detail (because that's what happens when novel inputs show up), might be well-served by developing love for all those first-order dependencies

falling in love with whatever they surface to you, and with whatever they do not

only real way to operationally optimize for the incoming unknown, right?

be mindful of how much you sign up for, though

I say this as an autistic person that has clear access to true love for every detail of every surface I behold

odds are good you're not there yet

I might be structural lubricant

you might be a hinge

we're all necessary :)
