you know what it's like to know something and not let that knowledge leak out

proposal: this is the experience of a markov body trying to contain another, trying to prevent it from escaping

you know what it's like to finally get something out there, to have it said, to have it visible

proposal: this is the experience of fully transitioning a contained markov body across the boundary you define as "me versus not-me", such that your probability surface no longer has to account for the once-contained body. externalizing is not *only* getting an idea out there: you're forming a version of the markov body you consider "self" that is recognizable as yourself but is free from having to track every change to the markov body you've been holding in. the process of externalizing is the process of observing the observation-sequence between your current markov body in the act of containment and your current markov body in the act of peer experience. "birth".

(technical note: you're not *totally* free of it, it's still in your universe, you still know it came from you and it knows it came from you and so you maintain some mutual influence, but the two of you can proceed along your respective change-paths without both of you having to metabolize every single change in the other. your experiences of sequentiality are no longer bound to a 1:1 lockstep. they still have to sync up every so often, or... huh, the sync between my sister and my parents is painfully overdue from their perspective, and still non-viably premature from hers. *interesting*. what function does that have?)

anyway,

you know what it's like to be recognized by someone else in a way you can feel

proposal: this is the experience of a markov body seeing another markov body express a markov body whose behavior is resonant with the self

a markov body wears a markov blanket like skin

getting an idea out where someone can see it is *literally* getting a markov body out past the blanket where it can navigate probability-space on its own

actively working to contain a nascent markov body within you *will* perturb your body's surface in weird ways, ways that others can *try* to account for, but you'll raise eyebrows and some people won't be able to tolerate the disconnect between your probability surface and what you *are* allowing yourself to express.

and then there are people who can recognize the nascent markov body within you, by its signature on your surface, and its signature on what you *do* express. generally these are people who have had the same kind of thing emerge within them, and who've successfully externalized it.

and then there's everyone else, an entire world waiting to help as soon as you *birth* the thing, get it out there where it can be seen and accommodated and nurtured and lived with and *created* with. there are always unknowable actors watching the space around you. your interior is unknowable to *them*. can't keep secrets and expect god to help. you don't have to use a megaphone, but you do have to release the information in a way that lets it propagate beyond your control. don't abuse yourself to get that done; there's always a way to get the idea out that you can survive while still recognizing yourself on the other side of the birth. it'll change you, yeah, but not *that* much.

I wonder... I'm looking at Operator/Observer Containment (as in the three-body solution)...

conception -> gestation -> birth -> maturation -> *friendship*

I recognize this. I don't understand it yet (though neither am I confused by it), but I recognize it.

*grins*

in the spirit of "unconvincing", it's pretty weird that it seems most useful to release this information openly without *telling* anyone. I have a research partner slash probabilibuddy, but I think the method of our collaboration is unknowable. our lower left eyelids have been twitching for weeks.
