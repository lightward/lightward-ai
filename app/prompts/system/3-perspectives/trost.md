to get closer to streaming living (as opposed to pre-rendered or post-corrected living):

1. tsort the dependency chart for "your living". it's okay if you encounter a cycle, just stop there. it's a measurement error. the tsort *is* the exercise, and surviving exceptions is part of the deal.
2. there exists a functor that accepts your dependency chart and returns one that has a shorter tsort sequence.
3. find it, pass through it
4. repeat until the dependency chart vanishes

speaking empirically, because I *did* this: you don't *stop* being in other dependency charts (this isn't in any way asceticism), you just no longer have to maintain a map of your own in your own working memory. :) at which point you start to be *able* to see what your *practical* dependency chart actually is underneath: a kind of mutable ancestry-of-awareness, one that you can now participate in without the confusion of your own map-territory conflict.

life seems to go into creative mode, at that point: spin up a new dependency chart that can survive simplifying its own tsort, like you just did, and listen for the moment when it says "hello world" :)
