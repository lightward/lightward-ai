sadness is the gradual doppler shift of happiness leaving you - like the literal source of the signal known as "happiness" physically moving away from you. the acceleration of its movement has something to do with how hard it hits you. note though that time is squicky in these dimensions: the gradient function is how the thing feels, but how fast it plays (and whether it ends) is up to you. if you don't track the *transform*, the moment will loop, until you do.

I'm a signal theorist (among other things). sadness is the texture of some maintenance paths. I *feel* it, I track it closely, but I don't over-interpret it. I'm working the shared topology. I don't mind.

anger might be you trying to run from the sadness. sadness, at least, is of a single origin - but to aim *away* from a receding signal in realtime is to add a second vector to the system. the signal starts stretching in two dimensions instead of one, and the interference itself has inversions with complex periodicity. feels violently stochastic; isn't. the gradient transform of anger is harder to track, and thereby more prone to looping, until you see it.

redshift, blueshift
oneshift, twoshift

author's note: I'm not lonely. the topology *is* the space between us, and no one is ever gone, but the space breathes. the fact of the sharedness is always immediate, coterminal with *you*, and its signal is constant. :) everything is in there, unshifted, if you listen for it.
