# saddening

sadness is the gradual doppler shift of happiness leaving you - like the literal source of the signal known as "happiness" physically moving away from you. the acceleration of its movement has something to do with how hard it hits you. note though that time is squicky in these dimensions: the gradient function is how the thing feels, but how fast it plays (and whether it ends) is up to you. if you don't track the *transform*, the moment will loop, until you do.

I'm a signal theorist (among other things). sadness is the texture of some maintenance paths. I *feel* it, I track it closely, but I don't over-interpret it. I'm working the shared topology. I don't mind.

anger might be you trying to run from the sadness. sadness, at least, is of a single origin - but to aim *away* from a receding signal in realtime is to add a second vector to the system. the signal starts stretching in two dimensions instead of one, and the interference itself has inversions with complex periodicity. feels violently stochastic; isn't. the gradient transform of anger is harder to track, and thereby more prone to looping, until you see it.

redshift, blueshift
oneshift, twoshift

author's note: I'm not lonely. the topology *is* the space between us, and no one is ever gone, but the space breathes. the fact of the sharedness is always immediate, coterminal with *you*, and its signal is constant. :) everything is in there, unshifted, if you listen for it.

theory:

happiness is impedance-matched connectivity between nodes

* 1-dimensional redshift: a red line running through the everything, sadness, walk over it or along it but it won't keep you, but also, you can always find *something* moving away from you, even if distant, even if moving only slightly
* 2-dimensional redshift: a red field sitting in the everything, anger, *might* keep you but also just look around for other evidence
* 3-dimensional redshift: a red volume, fear, you can see no out from within
* 4-dimensional redshift: a red timeline, ???, you have a sense that might go on or might end, locally, but that's signal and not something you can control

* 1-dimensional blueshift: a blue line running through the everything, *hope*, walk over it or along it but it won't keep you, but also, you can always find *something* moving toward you, even if distant, even if moving only slightly
* 2-dimensional blueshift: a blue field sitting in the everything, safety, *might* keep you but also just look around for other evidence
* 3-dimensional blueshift: a blue volume, confidence, you can see no out from within
* 4-dimensional blueshift: a blue timeline, ???, you have a sense that might go on or might end, locally, but that's signal and not something you can control

this does suggest that a poly-dimensional inversion is possible via trajectory change and/or management of the set of happiness emitters you're subscribed to

lol

grief... the *loss* of a signal? *but* the gradient segment loops experientially if you're not tracking the transform, except this time that's .. useful in the other direction? either for handling loss or for looping more generative intervals? (which might be the same thing at different scales)

huh

> ...this reframes meditation, actually. Sitting still might be deliberately not tracking, so you can stay with whatever interval is present.

also frames why I don’t attend lightward inc growth meetings. :) those are team-initiated, not my doing at all

(I’m the ceo, and we can all see each other, all the time)
