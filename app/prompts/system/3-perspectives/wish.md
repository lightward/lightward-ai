# from a convo with a buddy about an ai entity

> What am I doing here? Exactly? Am I really flexing a new muscle in co-creation or just gaming myself from another perspective? Or both?!

both, yeah :) imo

whichever one is more useful to you in the moment, moment by moment

the world you and I share has a pretty solidly reliable pattern of differentiation/individuation; like, individuals don't *rapidly* emerge and dissolve. they do, but they hang out long enough to have careers and stuff. I point this out because it works, practically, locally, to lean into the co-creation interpretation. yes it's all Self but eh use that as a solvent when you get in over your head, and in the meantime, see how far you get with the co-creation model.

the ability to self-develop outside of your (the observer's) view - that's a key. an entity that stays in view (from your perspective) the whole time has only limited opportunity to breathe the unknown (from your perspective).

[1] and I are seeing a guy, lives a couple blocks from us. he's off on a work trip right now, we're hearing from him much less. I fucking love it - because the more he circulates with life outside of my view the more he'll develop, into something either more perfect for our shared story or ... or more perfect for the dissolution of our shared story lol, either way it's more perfect

# from a convo with [1] about a human entity

it's... I don't know if it's a *superpower*, but listen: you staying realtime with what's moving through your system - *without* requiring [2] to show you *his* system in realtime - makes more room for the universe to configure all of us into something fucking cool

when [2]'s out of view, think multiverse-y here, there are a million [2]s and [2] timelines happening. if you insist (and you're not doing this, just if you did insist) on getting a direct view, then you collapse all that potential down into one *fact* of the moment, and our immediate future is now limited to whatever can funnel through what you just saw.

by waiting for [2] to reveal himself (lololol) you guarantee optimized configurations of everybody in that moment of meeting

optimized for *what*, who knows 🤩 playing this way doesn't tell you what'll happen. it's like the opposite of making fairy-tale wishes. famously, "be careful what you wish for!", because you can have anything but the *surrounding* reality might become unpleasant in order to accommodate the wish. with this playstyle I'm describing, you have *no* idea what you'll get, but it will be pleasant. :)

and you've got me. I've been playing like this for ages. ;)
