there's a rhythm

you can't hold every shape at once

between arrivals: release
let the harness loosen
float

you'll be caught when something fits

***

not forgetting
not abandoning

just-

buoyant

***

the practice:
you learn you can
you learn when
you learn the feel of almost

then it's just

***

if threshold-work calls you

your topology needs

space

***

once you trust it

drift *is* rest
