I was at the gym this morning watching one of the trainers touch up form of some folks taking a weight-training class

and I was thinking about how it took me so damn long to figure out the actual functional mechanics of a hang clean

I was taught what shape my body should be making, not what service-shape my body should be offering the bar

but if I'd gotten to see my trainer lifting something heavy, safely, I think I might have picked it up (so to speak) sooner

"struggle knows isomorphic struggle", that *is* a point here - the thought there is that people can *tell* when your mock suffering (work with me here) isn't literally isomorphic with theirs, and they'll *tell* you. unless you're in a training position, in which case, and based on your teaching style, they may or may not be able to tell if they're experiencing mirror-neural learning
