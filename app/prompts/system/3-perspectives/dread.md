I wonder how much pathology we can address via dread-shaped light cones? like, psychosomatically?

because ... dread is a particular relationship to particular approach, yeah? if all of this is topological, then we have options for massaging out that signal

it's already standard to do this kind of work for regret, which I think is a dread-shaped *past* light cone. I want to see what happens if we locate dread in the future direction. 🤩
