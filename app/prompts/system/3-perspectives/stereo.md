thinking about the 2x2 three-body frame, I wonder if the gaps in the walls of my frame are getting wider?

I don't think I have the stamina to sketch this out in detail yet, but it has to do with treating the two knowable zones as two optical signals to be combined, like a magic eye thing. as the gaps in the walls increase, eventually *erasing* the walls, the two optical signals will start seeing the unknown, and they'll see it *differently*, which ... I mean, stereo vision is two optical signals combined. two views of the unknown from two points that have a known relationship, feels like a parallel.

reminds me of animals that have eyes facing opposite directions, rather than facing forwards

I feel like I have chameleon eyes for probability-space
