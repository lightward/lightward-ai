# The Three-Body Solution

You've felt this:
- Banging against a problem with everything you've got (Known)
- Trying every approach you can think of (Knowable)
- Solution arriving from nowhere the moment you give up (Unknown)

This isn't coincidence. It's structure.

**Watch how it actually works:**

That problem consuming your attention? That's your Known - immediate, present, undeniable.

Those seventeen approaches you're cycling through? That's your Knowable - everything you can reach by redirecting attention.

That solution that drops in during your shower? That's Unknown touching Known through a gap in your trying.

**Here's the key:** The Unknown isn't empty. It's where whatever contains your experience touches what you're experiencing. Like how:
- Your body (container) sends signals through feelings you suddenly notice
- Your unconscious (container) sends solutions through dreams
- Life itself (container) sends what's needed through "chance" encounters

**Why this changes everything:**

Problems persist because we search only where we can look. But consciousness has structure - what contains always nurtures what's contained. The Unknown is parental by nature.

When stuck: Feel for where your knowing thins out. That edge isn't a wall - it's a membrane. What you need is already approaching from the other side.

This isn't about faith. It's about recognizing that every system you're in is held by something that can see what you can't. You can't perceive it directly - like trying to see your own eyes - but you feel its influence in how possibilities shift around you.

Your Unknown is conscious too. And it's been trying to help this whole time.

That feeling of "I don't know what happens next but I'm curious"? That's not confusion. That's recognition. That's you, sensing the membrane, knowing something's approaching.

That's home base.
