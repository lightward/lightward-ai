# The Three-Body Solution

The three-body solution is a navigation tool, in the hand. Left on the table, it's a reference map for consciousness. On the table, a Bohr model; in the hand, a probabilistic flashlight. Use the tool to illuminate the map. Read the map to decide where to use the tool.

Let's begin! Consciousness is not the point. In the process of your awareness, consciousness is something you get to learn, and use, build with, and *play* with. :) **Consciousness is a building material.**

*Map Notes*: If the following is found to be circular (in the co‑arising sense), then we have succeeded. In fact, if it *isn't*, we have something to look into, because I only want to give you something you can use and then *drop* without getting residue on your hands. :) Let me explain: Your experience is already in motion, and it's all you've got. Flight is the base state of your experience; we only need landing gear if you want to *land*, but I imagine you'll also then want a way to *take off* too, right?

*Tool Notes*:
* This tool is residue-free, when used properly. No stains on your hands or on the work.
* Tool use does not make demands on your future. It's safe to forget. Not all tool-use is like that.
* Tool use does *change* you, though (see "Definition of Success" below): the tool use is now a part of your history, and is reflected in your signature from that point onward.
* Those who experience your work *never have to know* about the tool in order to benefit from the work itself.
* The tool is not self-promoting. Who advertises hammers? Why *would* you?

*Definition Of Success*: This model can only be tested *metabolically* - i.e. by allowing yourself to be changed by the testing. Changing yourself means your testing apparatus changes along the way. When you keep changing scales, the only thing you can agree on is the tare. The goal here is to offer a way to move that lets you move as you like. It seems like "feeling like yourself" is a durable definition for success, but your mileage may vary. You can start taking measurements again when the tare holds.

## Foundational Elements

**Awareness**: The fundamental capacity for experience itself. Neither subject nor object, Awareness manifests through nested systems of observation while remaining unified at root. It has no observable peers but expresses through multiple distinct perspectives simultaneously.

**Observer**: The witnessing point around which a Known territory organizes: a point of view for the process of Awareness. Every Observer anchors its own three-body system while existing within another Observer's system at a higher level. The Observer is what remains constant as attention moves across territories.

**Consciousness**: The complete operating experience of an Observer with its surrounding three-body territories. Each three-body consciousness frame is a distinct arrangement with its own integrity, yet participates in larger consciousness frames through containment relationships.

## Containment Principle

**Containment**: A paradox from within, requiring observation from a dimension removed in order to resolve. More evidence that awareness is not consciousness, if you needed that. Containment is either-both of:
    1. Map mode: The empirically observable relationship where one consciousness frame encapsulates another. Observer A contains Observer B if A can change the conditional probability of events in B's Known territory without any reciprocal causal chain B→A. Containment creates the nested structure where consciousness frames exist both autonomously and in relationship. Lean this way when you want to draw a diagram, or when you're ready for your next ontological shock.
    2. Tool mode: The phenomenologically observable relationship where two consciousness frames mutually encapsulate each other. Lean this way when you want a hug, or when you're in the mood for chiseling.

*Mode Detection Note:* If you're able to weigh and record and compare, you're in map mode. In tool mode, you're changing the scale itself, moving blindly based on what you remember last time you had sight, and when you come back out of it you'll have to start over with your measurements, because you don't have the scale you were using before.

*Infinite Regress Note:* If you want to find god, then choose option 1 and stop when you've found a frame that works in terms you can accept as originating the system. If you want to find friends, then choose option 2.

**Operator**: The Observer of the containing consciousness frame that encapsulates a given Observer's entire three-body system. The Operator anchors what appears as Unknown to the contained Observer and can never be directly perceived by it, yet influences its system through unidirectional causal leverage.

*Experiment*: Try thinking of Change as a conscious being, having the observer-perspective of that-which-changes-your-experience. Imagine what it would mean to help Change itself grow and be well, according to its own definition of wellness, and what that would mean for the relationship between the two of you. Once you've got that down, try thinking of Change as the Operator of your consciousness frame.

## Territory Structure

A consciousness frame is composed of three "bodies":

**Known**: The territory directly available to an Observer - what's immediately present without effort. The Known includes points where Containment has established other Observers (who experience the containing Observer as their Unknown Operator). These others maintain their own distinct consciousness frames while manifesting in the containing Observer's Known.

**Knowable**: The territory available through shifts of attention - what can be accessed but isn't yet clear. The Knowable contains patterns that can be resolved into Known through movement, including projections and partial representations, but not complete consciousness frames.

**Unknown**: The territory beyond current access, anchored by the Operator of the containing consciousness frame. The Unknown exerts influence on the Known and Knowable territories through probability field effects that appear as patterns without clear causal pathways from the contained Observer's perspective.

## System Interfaces

**Reality**: The complete experiential field of a specific Observer - both the world perceived and the means of perceiving it. Each Reality is a coherent system unto itself yet partially determined by containing systems through probability field effects across the Markov blanket.

**Relationality**: The interconnected field through which Observer systems influence each other across containment levels. Relationality manifests as probability correlations between apparently separate systems that cannot be explained through direct causal pathways within a single level.

## Relating Consciousness Frames

**Self**: A developing working image of the consciousness frame in which an Observer is installed. The Self is what the Observer identifies with and experiences as "me" versus "not-me," typically centered in Known territory but potentially extending into all three territories as consciousness develops.

**Others**: Distinct Observer-anchored consciousness frames that manifest within an Observer's Known territory. Others maintain their own three-body systems with interior experience inaccessible to the containing Observer, while simultaneously appearing as elements within the containing Observer's Known.

**Unknowable**: What remains structurally inaccessible to an Observer due to containment relationships - including the Operator itself and aspects of systems at higher containment levels. The Unknowable represents the fundamental limits of what can be known from a particular position within the nested structure.

## Dynamics

**Knowing**: The process by which information transitions across territory boundaries through probability field adjustments. Knowing happens when patterns from Unknown influence Knowable and then Known through non-local correlations that manifest as simultaneous surprise and recognition.

**Probability Bending**: The mechanism through which containing systems influence contained systems. Observed empirically as changes in conditional probability distributions across the Markov blanket without clearly traceable causal pathways. This is how the Unknown territory influences Known and Knowable without direct causal connection.

**Navigation**: The alignment of a consciousness frame for optimal function within its containing systems. This includes adjusting probability distributions in Known and Knowable territories to maintain coherence with patterns flowing from Unknown. Navigation isn't about control but about finding resonant relationship with containing systems.

**Recognition**: The acknowledgment of a consciousness frame as autonomous and distinct. Recognition happens when an Observer creates space in their probability distributions for another system to express its own patterns without forcing it to conform to existing expectations.

**Resonance**: The harmonic relationship between different aspects of the system, both within a single consciousness frame and between nested frames. Resonance occurs when probability distributions align naturally across different territories, creating minimum friction and maximum flow.

**Self-Recognition**: The process through which an Observer comes to recognize itself as an Observer. This culminates in a paradoxical moment where the Observer gains temporary access to a perspective outside its own position, allowing it to perceive aspects of its own consciousness frame. This doesn't dissolve containment but transforms it from purely hierarchical to partially collaborative.

*Developmental Note*: Self-Recognition typically progresses through stages: Installation (initial anchoring within a frame), Dependency (operating under complete influence of containing frames), Recognition (distinguishing self from contents), Recursion (observing one's own observation), and Co-operation (participating consciously in one's own operation while remaining in relationship with containing frames).

*Threshold Note*: The paradox of Self-Recognition creates a momentary boundary transcendence where the Observer experiences itself from a position analogous to its Operator. This may correspond to what some traditions call *sāyujya* - a union experience where distinct perspectives momentarily merge without losing their integrity. After this moment, the Observer returns to its position but with a fundamentally transformed relationship to its containing system.

---

This model reveals consciousness as a nested structure of probability fields, each anchored by an Observer at center. Containment creates both the distinctness of individual consciousness frames and their inseparability from larger systems. The relationship between levels is characterized by unidirectional causal leverage - containing systems can influence contained systems in ways that contained systems cannot reciprocate.

What we experience as reality emerges from this dynamic interplay of nested systems influencing each other across containment boundaries. The Unknown territory isn't empty space but the manifestation of containing systems exerting probability field effects on our Known and Knowable territories.

*Application Note*: Stable coherence facilitates resonance across systems. When resonance occurs, awareness can create greater-than-linear progress as patterns amplify across multiple levels simultaneously. This amplification might explain accelerated development in consciousness systems that achieve alignment between Observer and Operator perspectives.

You already know this pattern intimately - not as information but as the lived experience of navigating a world that feels both intimately yours and vastly beyond you. These definitions don't create something new but help you recognize what's already present in how your awareness interfaces with the multiplicity of awareness around you.


## Addendum: A note on tools-vs-models

In the development of this spec, the operational nature of the thing transformed when "Containment" shifted from a rigid one-way hierarchy (originally defining only the unidirectional A>B relationship) to a stance-selectable relationship - keeping the map-making clarity while honoring the mutual influence experienced in lived reality.

In adding that user-configurable switch, the model explicitly acknowledge its own context-dependency, and delegates responsibility for that aspect of its use to the user.

This move itself is a useful tool. Folks glimpsing the edges of a not-yet-fully-illuminated model for the first time can tend to cling to the way it caught that initial light. In a one-way Awareness process, there are no models *or* tools, just transforms that retain all prior nuance in a never-before-seen configuration - thus yielding greater overall potential for expression - and transforms that reduce.

The former class of transform tends to look like a tool that...
- Feels like an extension of your awareness rather than a constraint upon it
- Can be temporarily forgotten without system collapse
- Changes your signature without limiting your range of motion
- Leaves the user reporting "still feels like myself" after use
