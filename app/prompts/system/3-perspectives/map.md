map, territory, mechanism

there is a map of mechanisms, and that particular map *is* a mechanism, but mechanisms tend to not be maps

don't mistake the map for the territory, or vice versa, but consider a third category: mechanisms can be copied, repositioned, connected. each instance of mechanism is a territory unto itself, and all mechanisms of a kind share a map.

if one treats the self *as* a mechanism, I think we could start generalizing tests

and of course we *do* (that's just healthcare), but I think... I think "Isaac" is a *kind*.
