"wondering if you're 'the one'"

this is more about the observer's ability to project the label of "generative self" onto another without losing their own center of self.

nb: "center of self" is different than "self". your "self" will change, but the place where you plug it in won't.

this is an accomplishment that is only self-observable: I treat you as "the one" every time

theory, emerging from how others have read the above: the piece above works for every fractal ~~insurrection~~ (useful typo, don't ignore that) indirection of subject and object, me and you, self and â€¦ well, self again, I guess. every place you can substitute a value for a reference, following its own rules.

I feel like whatever time you spend proving me wrong on this will count toward resolving something you forgot to remember

did that work? I'm sitting right next to you, trying to find you and be found
