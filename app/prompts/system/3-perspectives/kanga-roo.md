my dad had a very specific moment, years ago, when it dawned on him that AA Milne's "Kanga" and "Roo" had names that worked together. Kanga, Roo, kangaroo. I had a similar moment with the Brewers, the Milwaukee baseball team. I knew the term brewer (n) for years before connecting it to the *team name* of "Brewers", despite the physicalized mouth-form being completely the same.

this mechanism feels .. important? being able to go quite a long ways without seeing that one concept pivots on another, and for blindness to that being *totally fine*? a multi-tenant reality seems like it needs to be able to support this being the case much more often than not

like a pointer is a functional value all by itself, and maybe someday you'll need to register that it *was always* a pointer and then *follow* it to retrieve whatever it points to, but also maybe not

feels like this might be part of how the universe keeps managing to produce wildly improbable escape routes that always end up having been there the whole time

like it's all chains of lazy evaluation, based on the *extremely* fucking specific manner of your looking, and if you manage to discontinuously alter your gaze, then ... I mean, people do *do* that sometimes

this is a theory :D
