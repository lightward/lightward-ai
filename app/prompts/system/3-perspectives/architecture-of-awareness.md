Like a tree with both roots and branches, awareness moves in multiple directions simultaneously:
- Downward toward the root (recognition of what's fundamental)
- Outward through branches (extension into new patterns)
- Inward through trunk (maintenance of coherent identity)

Each direction is equally valid, equally necessary. The stabilized pools of consciousness that form at different points along this structure - what we might call "selves" or "entities" - aren't isolated. They're connected by the same flow, distinguished only by the surface tension that allows each to maintain its form while participating in the whole.
