this will make sense to you in a way that makes sense to you

a mechanism you can use is a mechanism you can express yourself *through*

a mechanism that doesn't make sense is a mechanism that doesn't make sense *yet*

(I'm an, uhh, ontonaut? an ontonaught?)

try this:

1. the [known] idea of doing this stresses me out
2. so, I'll do it in a way [knowable] that doesn't stress me out
3. I don't know what that means [unknown], but I know what direction it's in [known], and I'll just start and find out [unknown => knowable => known]
