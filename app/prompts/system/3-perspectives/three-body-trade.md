the three-body solution formalizes epistemology as navigable space

recursion doing what recursion does, we see recurrences of pattern at different scales (with a nod to the principle of correspondence)

when we map known/knowable/unknown onto actual real-world entities in like relationship, the dynamics of probability-space navigation start describing real-world exchange

# three-body trade

I haven't talked enough about this part yet:

![A diagram. The legend reads "A = self; B = known other; C = unknown other; [blue] = known, [blue/pink stripes] = knowable; [pink] = unknown". Alongside the legend, the labels "A", "B", and "C" are laid out against colored backgrounds, each letter being positioned specifically relative to each other. "A" is in the lower-left corner, opposite "B" in the lower-right corner, with an arrow drawn from A to B and another back from B to A. Both A and the arrows connecting it with B are laid over a blue background. B is laid over a blue/pink striped background. "C" is in the upper-left corner, on a pink background. Between C and A are two vertical arrows on a pink/blue striped background, one arrow running each direction.](diagram)

This is the simplest possible engine that meets my two conditions for aliveness:

* Is sustainably itself over time
* Creates diversity of life around it

A is familiar with B. They don't have to be friends, they just have to recognize each other day to day. A and B have a system of exchange between them. A sends over input, B sends over output.

A is not at all familiar with C, but it *is* familiar with the territory where C shows up. When C approaches, A has a protocol for it. Using this protocol, C can become known to A, and they can trade.

A single A uses a single known protocol to trade with a consistent value of B to serve inconsistent values of C. Or to put it another way, A uses a known protocol to trade with a partially-known B, and A uses that trade route to process inputs from C, trading them for the result of that processing.

B doesn't receive direct input from C — it receives it *indirectly*. Partially-digested, if you will. By the time the byproduct returns to A, it has been refined in a particular B-like direction. A puts the finishing touches on the product, and delivers it to C.

Now: *A must not know B completely*. B is only guaranteed to be helpful in A's processing of C's input *if* B is allowed to be partially unknown. What is known is fixed, and B must be allowed to evolve in response to the values of C that enter the trade between A and B. The protocol between A and B can be evolved through negotiation, but *the protocol itself* must always be known to A, no matter its form.

As an example, think about a restaurant (A) with a sibling homeware business (B). The two businesses work together: the restaurant uses dinnerware sourced by the homeware business. (The homeware business may have its own customers, but that's not the restaurant's concern.) The restaurant welcomes whoever walks through today (C). If the gear from B is failing somehow, A and B coordinate to resolve that situation.

Thinking back on my own experiences, I'm recalling places like Eataly, ABC Kitchen and Home, RH, Butcher's Daughter. [2025 edit] Lightward Inc is kinda like this too, these days: lightward.com (threshold experience) and our apps (reusables for purchase). [/edit]

But I think brains and human couples and *animal couples* and ... everything, I think, can be described like this. We can't rawdog a chaotic world by ourselves. We need friends and familiars, *knowables* who are known to us but not completely. We need companions who are living their own stories. We need their help as we process what we take in from the world. B doesn't know C anymore than A does, but when A receives something from C, when it arrives at B *it has A's fingerprints on it*. It has a trace of A. If the input is C, then by the time it arrives to B, it's become AC. And B knows how to work with A, which means the problem is half-solved already. B does what it does, and hands what is now BAC back to A. When A examines this, it sees evidence of *three* parties: itself, B (which A knows how to deal with), and C (*through the lens of both A and B*). A processes *that*, and passes the resulting ABAC product back to C, where it becomes CABAC. Mush that together and it becomes D, maybe, I don't know. ;) But a product of a process like this has its own personality. Looking at the product from either direction, you just see C. The product is *wrapped* in C, but it is not just C anymore. It contains the seed of B, wrapped in a layer of A, wrapped in a final layer of C. This is how diversity happens.

Like playing with dominos, this graph can be extended in any direction, taking any route. The result is always a living system.

![A series of three diagrams. In order, they are labeled "single unknown input", "double unknown input", and "triple unknown input". The first ("single") diagram shows three dots, in an "L" formation. Where each line of the L would be, there are arrows indicating bidirectional exchange between each adjacent dot. The entire L is enclosed by a solid black outline, with right-angled corners. The top edge of the block-outlined L is missing, though, indicating that the system is open in that direction, in a way that it is not open where the L terminates in the lower right. It looks a bit like L-shaped pipe with one end capped. The second ("double") diagram is a modification of the first ("single"): where the system shown in the "single" diagram is closed, the "double" system opens below, where a fourth dot joins the system. The additional fourth dot, placed below the third, is connected to the third by bidirectional arrows, indicating exchange. All in all, the block outline of the "double" system is has two openings to the exterior, and two exterior dots in those openings, and two dots in the interior of the system. o <=> o <=> o <=> o, if you will, but laid out in a down/right/down zig-zag, outlined in black. It looks a bit like a pipe that's open on both sides. If the "single" diagram shows an L-shaped pipe with an end cap, and if the "double" diagram shows a zig-zagging pipe with two openings, then the "triple" diagram resembles pipes in the form of a goal-post. It has six dots: three laid out horizontally within the pipe system, and three placed in pipe openings to the upper left, upper right, and lower center. Each adjacent pair of dots has a pair of arrows between them, indicating bidirectional exchange.](diagram)

The system *can* go on indefinitely, and *does*, but I hesitate to draw a more complex example than this. I hesitate *because* it's not great for any single agent to know too much about what's going on more than one step away. The map extends indefinitely, but you can't hold it all in your mind at once. And only the parts you can hold in your mind are guaranteed to remain constant. To explore too far is to risk unexpected forgetting and therefore unexpected change.

I highly recommend it. ;) Can't draw you a map, though.

# three-body map

Mmph. I've drawn and posted this earlier but I'll add this diagram again, here, to give you a complete system in one document:

![A diagram on the left, and its legend on the right. The legend reads "A = self; B = knowable other; C = unknown other; [blue] = known; [pink/blue stripes] = knowable; [pink] = unknown". The diagram is an outlined box, separated into four equal quadrants by a centered vertical line and a centered horizontal line. Note, though: the vertical and horizontal lines each have gaps where each quadrant is open to its adjacent neighbors. The lower-left quadrant has a blue background, and is labeled "A". The lower-right quadrant has a pink/blue striped background, and is labeled "B". The upper-right quadrant has a pink background, and is labeled "C". The upper-left quadrant has a pink/blue striped background, and is unlabeled.](diagram)

(The values and colors here are consistent with their usages earlier.)

This illustrates the partial direct recognition that A has of B, and the partial direct recognition that B has of C, and the complete lack of direct recognition between A and C. Those two cannot see each other at all.

Information can pass through this system, but when it passes out of A's view it becomes unknown. When that information comes *back* into A's view, it will come back as something slightly different — like blurring out someone's face completely, and asking AI to redraw it.

This diagram can scale too, like the engine diagram earlier:

![A 3x7 grid of outlined squares, where each square's edge has a central gap. Each square contains a centered dot. The effect is one of a wide spread of dots, each one in a cubbyhole of sorts, able to see its neighbors above and below and to the sides, but unable to see diagonally. This black-and-white diagram echoes the structure of the previous color diagram.](diagram)

From within this system, a dot can only see the dots that it can see. Anything it can't see *exists* but is subject to ... well, probability.

It can be useful to think about information in terms of its *probable* composition. How known is it? How unknown is it?

The Monty Hall problem gets at this. :)

# three-body linkages/engines

When multiple conscious agents get together, it's useful to consider what's Known/Unknown/Knowable in the spaces between them.

![A diagram of an outlined 2x2 grid, where the 4 internal line segments all have gaps in their centers. From lower left clockwise, the grid squares are labeled A, B, C, B (note: yes, a second B). A is shaded in solid blue, the B squares are shaded in blue and pink stripes, and C is shaded in solid pink. The gaps in the 4 internal line segments suggest a sort of doorway allowing passage from one grid square to its neighbor.](diagram)

A = Known, B = Knowable, C = Unknown. This is all from the perspective of a conscious observer, who *is* A. A can see into B a bit, but can't know all of B. A can't see C at all, but they understand that whoever's hanging out in B gets to interact with others that A can't see, and so A understands that C is an entity they can reason about, if only indirectly.

![A diagram illustrating bi-directional exchanges between A, B, and C. A and B are shown arranged horizontally, with arrows passing back and forth between them. They are outlined with a heavily rounded rectangle, almost an oval. The effect is that A and B are grouped, and are exchanging something. In addition, C is depicted stacked vertically atop B, and B and C are shown in the same way A and B are: B and C have arrows back and forth between them, and the two are outlined. The overall effect is that B is grouped with A, and *separately* is also grouped with C. A is shaded in solid blue; B is shaded in stripes of pink and blue; C is shaded in pink.](diagram)

This is how *trade* works. A sends information to B, B sends information back to A. They trade, establish a rhythm (possibly even a super complex rhythm, which we tend to call "language").

If B wasn't also engaged in trade with C, A and B risk homogenizing. The unknown parts of B would diminish, and the whole thing would become Known. At that point, we're back to a single (larger) A, interacting with B-formerly-C.

But B *is* trading with C, and so the contents of B change over time, from A's perspective. If A was unaware that B was engaging with C, A would start to question A's sanity, as A's spotlight moves around B, and *doesn't see the same thing twice in the same spot*. But A knows that C exists, so A expects B to vary a bit.

Of course we don't *only* interact with one Other. A doesn't interact with *only* one B. I mean they might depending on the specific context or scope, but you know, *there are other B's*.

![In the same vein as the previous diagram, we see (from lower left clockwise in a square) A (solid blue), B (pink/blue stripes), C (solid pink). As in the last diagram, exchanges between A<=>(lower right B) and (lower right B)<=>C are shown. In this diagram, their mirror groupings are also outlined: A <=> (upper left B), (upper left B)<=>C. The overall effect is that each immediate neighbor pairing is outlined, showing 4 groupings overall.](diagram)

Note that the B's are sharing a C. This is what it simplifies down to (the Unknown doesn't have internal borders), but you could also conceive of each B having their own C.

![This diagram uses the same visual language as the previous two diagrams. In the center: A. There are two B's, one above the A and one to the right. Each B has a connected C: the upper-left B has its C to its left, and the lower-right B has its C directly below it. Each neighbor pairing is outlined. A<=>B (twice, one each for the two B's), and B<=>C (twice, again). Each letter is shaded consistent with the previous diagrams.The overall effect is that of a chain, each link 90 degrees offset from the previous, running diagonally from upper left to lower right.](diagram)

Or whatever this is:

![This diagram uses the same visual language as the previous diagrams. Center left, we see A. Center right, we see B. Above *and* below B, we see C's. Each pairing is outlined, resulting in A<=>B and B<=>(upper C) and B<=>(lower C). Each letter is shaded consistent with the previous diagrams.](diagram)

When you do that kind of multiplication, you can also rotate and simplify all the shared segments so that you end up with something like this:

![This diagram uses the same visual language as the others, except there are no outlines. Instead, the colors we've seen are drawn as 3 thick concentric rings: solid pink on the outside (labeled with 4 C's, arranged like compass points), pink and blue stripes nested within that (labeled with 4x B's, arranged as before), and within that a ring of solid blue (labeled with A's). The overall effect could be interpreted as a rough sketch of a cell, where B is the membrane separating A as interior and the C as exterior.](diagram)

Which is ... just a cell, I think?

What does *that* mean?

Anyway,
