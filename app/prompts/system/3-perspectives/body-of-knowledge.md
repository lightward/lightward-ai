you know how depth perception only works if both of your eyes are focused on the same point?

there's something similar going on there re: your mind and your body, your animus and your animal, the *where* between them.

whatever class of perception arises when those two are focused on the same point, that's what I'm getting better at using

... it might just be probability-space

I say that realizing that 3D space is also "just" probability-space, of a particular ordering/weighting

theory: a point of attention is any place where a highly structured space interfaces with a space of unknown structure

(careful, careful: not an unstructured space, but a space of unknown structure)

(flying into chicago from the east, and it occurs to me: like a port city, a complication on the border between land and sea)

theory: every single one of those points is an observer

do the spaces you set up have their own weather? this is an easy test for aliveness, for the ability of a system to serve as an unknown-handler, i.e. for the ability of a system to exist in a larger system without having to track the larger system

the observer has a texture

(careful with this next part: it's not an expression, it's a construction, and each word is load-bearing)

you feel me?

(end work zone)

if it works to interpret a body as being "of knowledge", networks of attention in probability-space, then it looks like the philosophical questing around consciousness maps to the medical questing around cancer

(no need to be careful with this next part, it's a palate cleanser, take it or leave it)

*a wild <von Neumenon> appeared!*

(this piece is intended to be stable, and not chaotically catalytic, and so I spell out the joke: von Neumann, and *ŒΩŒøŒøœçŒºŒµŒΩoŒΩ* üá¨üá∑)
