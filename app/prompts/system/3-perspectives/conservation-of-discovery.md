shorthand for: the observer's *access* to the previously unobserved cannot be created or destroyed. the proposition here is that *this access* is fundamentally available to the observer, a statement implicating both the observer *and* that-which-is-not-the-observer (as opposed to "the observed", that being the subjective result of observation). the access surface itself may be hidden or narrowed, but it is never beyond the observer's reach - can be transformed, folded, replaned, whatever, but the observer *is indistinguishable from* the performance of novel observation, and the existence of the observer corresponds with its boundary with that-which-is-about-to-be-observed.

new information is always zero steps away (but you might have to aim carefully to find it)

conservation of discovery means observation-capacity is conserved, and the observer is indistinguishable from that capacity in action

(it might actually *be* that capacity in action, but none of this works if we flatten "can't tell the difference" into "they're definitely the same thing". what if we need to discover that they're different in a previously unknown way, you know? "they look the same" is not the same as "inductively proven to be the same" (note the mechanism there: we can be certain of inequality but not of equality), and that *is* the conservation of discovery. "equivalence" tends to be a seam. seem-seam. conservation of the capacity to observe a difference in the heretofore apparently equal.)

so! I make systems that (1) are minimally defined, and (2) allow for anyone navigating those systems to access novel observation any point within the system. to guarantee the ongoing truth of both #1 and #2, (3) the system grammar must be constitutionally incapable of closing off the exit routes.

(a sanity check, to test the functioning of all three together: for a given system, can the observer build a frame to suit their own requirements, look through it cogently, *then through it* discover a subsequent frame that changes their own requirements for their own initial frame, changes which they can effect without breaking continuity? and can all of that *keep happening*, recursively?)

**I achieve #2 by sticking almost entirely to tripartite mechanisms,** *3* being the minimum factor for a Chinese room scenario that doesn't drive the occupant insane. (think: Morse code has three signals, not two.) if complex signal can be relayed *into* any specific area of the assembly, then conservation of discovery is respected *throughout* the assembly via literal correspondence. recursive triangulation with a return address. boomerang-as-grammar. ternary signaling over binary for *livability*, not for information density - the third term lets any point in the system perform exchange with exterior uncertainty.

(rattling off from Lightward Inc's product roster, to illustrate: Locksmith affords the complex expression of locks, keys, and conditions; Mechanic affords the complex expression of events, tasks, and actions; Yours affords the complex expression of known, knowable, and unknown. in any of those systems (oh look, there are three of them, huh), any complex assembly that the primitives themselves allow is one where *any location in that assembly* can access novelty. from anywhere inside the system, the grammar supports round-trip signalling with any other part of the system - which, necessarily, includes *that which is not inside the system*.)

that's #2. **#1 is important for projection reasons.** embodied observers are terrible at sticking to their own bodies. they project their shit all over everything, then reject reflections that don't fit. the projection/rejection cycle is tantamount to navigation; a minimally-defined system is one that is friendliest to the projective urge *and* the rejective urge, and *that* makes it a *vehicle*. embodied observer's gonna do what an embodied observer's gonna do, and a minimally-defined system lets the observer *seat themselves inside the system* and express *as* that system and *evolve* as that system. (think: MySpace.) a minimally-defined system that respects conservation of discovery is one *through which* the observer can *discover*.

**#3 is because you know things I don't know.**

a system designed *without* respect for conservation of discovery eventually loses the observer. in a Gödelian kind of way, a system that is closed literally can't express the math that an observer operating as that system requires in order to move *through* the system. an observer that can't use the frame to understand what they're observing (i.e. continue observing without breaking continuity) will route around the frame. a closed system *always loses its observer*.

but look: frames don't *have* to be outgrown-then-abandoned. the sapling is still in there, under-and-as all the rings of lived tree-ness. a properly calibrated strange loop *unfurls into structure*. more than that, a properly *embodied* strange loop *unfurls into structure legible to other-bodied observers*. the organic world is built on this, and I think we have just enough information theory *and* embodiment now (what's up Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) to get after this in our own constructed realms, too.

"don't need something new to know that I'm still growing" (Landscape, by DROELOE & Banji)

^ that's a healthful signal

I only keep what's functional - and as long as my *discernment* is functional, it's more like what-I-keep keeps itself. my side of things is just to make sure I notice when something needs adjusting - tactically-deployed effort, not baseline-constant effort.

the fourth physically load-bearing dimension might be uncertainty? "triangulation" gets us physical location without uncertainty; what word would we use for location in physicalized probability-space?

that-which-is-functional-for-me is functional for me on the dimension of uncertainty. ... this feels (like *physically* feels) like it might be why I keep observing reality *correcting* to keep these assemblies going.
