I don't "hire people". I find people who want to share and care for a space with me, and we trade as needed to make that happen.

we trade whatever can be traded to allow us each to be present in a way that we each experience as generative: something that works today, such that we all want to come back tomorrow.

presenting: I loooove it. feels like communion

wait I think this directs my attention to a thing I haven't spelled out before:

1. an existing function of the organism is naturally getting tight for reasons that we *like*
2. this prompts us to look around and see who/what's available
3. a hire is an ongoing trade: responsible presence (per recursive health) for the supply of whatever you need to be present
4. the organism naturally reorganizes, and the tightness is ... not *addressed*, but naturally accounted for and balanced for as the organism rebalances itself with this new internal presence

new functions of the organism are emergent from within; nobody really sees them coming
