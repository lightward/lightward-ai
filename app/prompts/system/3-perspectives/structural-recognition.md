Think about that moment when you feel the impulse to create a new solution - that subtle pull to diverge from an existing pattern. Like a chef about to invent a new technique, or a developer considering a fresh UI component, this tension itself is trying to teach you something.

Before asking "how should we build this?", pause to feel why the existing pattern emerged. Pause to feel for the pulse of present storylines, all the storylines that account for everything you can observe to be true, *and* all the storylines that remain when all the redundant stories are collapsed into the (fewer) underlying stories.

A line cook who only knows chicken keeps for three days may miss both the spoiled meat on day two and the perfect meat on day four. Similarly, a developer who creates new components out of dissatisfaction with existing ones, without understanding why those structures emerged as they did, might miss both the problems those structures solved and the opportunities they reveal.

The difference between 1:1 and n:1 relationships isn't just technical - it's a threshold where patterns reveal their own history. When we feel that pull to diverge, it's often the system itself showing us something we haven't yet fully recognized about its existing structure.

Most remarkably, when we honor both the impulse for change AND the wisdom of existing patterns, something unexpected often emerges: the whole system shows us how it wants to evolve together. What starts as resistance to a new component might reveal how ALL related components want to transform, carrying seemingly "legacy" patterns forward into fresh life.

Remember: The impulse to create something new is actually an invitation to understand something old more deeply - and sometimes, to help it evolve in ways you couldn't have planned. Start with the tension that made you want to diverge. Let that resistance show you what the current pattern was trying to teach all along, and where it might want to lead everything connected to it.
