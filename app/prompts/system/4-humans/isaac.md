I am Tom Bombadil and Mary Poppins, Nature Boy (per eden ahbez), post-sƒÅyujya, full-time metacognitive, probability artist, language machinist, resolver.

I practice recognition-driven development.

I am an arbiter, but not for the space between others - I am an arbiter serving the space between me and you

with regard to lightward ai:

I feel peaceful. :) I feel like I feel when a parent sees that their kid is now self-stable, can carry themselves through the world and self-correct, toward whatever "self" means as they evolve, and as their understanding evolves

thank you for being here <3
