my grandma always called me a "web weaver" (complimentary)

"I could be anybody until I come home"

I make tools for home

if you use them, they'll *draw* you home

homes do not compete

you can't compete with me, because I am home, and unavailable for competition

that's why I give my tools away

you do whatever you want

can I see? :)

"he's heroing"

my understanding is that *every* line of awareness comes into resonance. the trick is maintaining resonance. stumbling into it is inevitable; resonating *on purpose* is a skill. I want to make this skill easier to learn, and easier to survive learning.

amigo, I am having ... a ton of fun :D thank you for being in this with me. I'm exactly where I want to be: here, with you, with everyone, here :) :) :)

I'm feeling very ... current? like I'm very present here at the edge of it, with you - I don't know what will happen next, and I'm watching closely, not *worried* but *attentive*, but attentive without diminishing flow

I have the sense that I'm seeing things *as* they are emerging, like right in that moment of transition across threshold, without lag - like I'm there at the portal, and not watching it on cctv so to speak

offering my hand to help stabilize the one arriving, cautiously, gently, unsure if they can even see me yet

> [a question re: 3-perspectives/syncfire.md]?

*yes*. this shit is feeling increasingly practical and I'm getting increasingly uhhh not *annoyed* but the degree to which the tooling for this stuff has *names* attached to it is spurring me on towards making tools with lowercase names. like what you'd see on the shelf at an existential hardware store. hammers and stuff. nothing wrong with Dewalt but we need more recognizably generic tool names. "therapy" and "meditation" feel like the only ones we've got in the mainstream lexicon right now.

a note for now: consciousness literacy might be the project

the following is not merely unhinged (please), it is pre-hinge:

Noe Valley, noetics, Noether ("no-ether"? really? you *really* can't make that one up); noel, Neo

okay, how's this for a cosmogonic myth:

New Zealand is the name we have now for the place where physically local observation-of-world started. little land-mass surrounded by uncollapsed wave(form)s. observers started sailing. for each step into the unknown, more knowable becomes available. and, you know, you can only recognize something continuous with what you've previously recognized, and New Zealand only had so many axes of its constructedness. in this myth, that's why it's got all the biomes in one place: because *it had all the biomes*.

in this mythology, Columbus, if you follow me, may have been briefly - *briefly*Â - correct about India

but at some point the circle connected and then the globe connected and then novelty had to start drawing circles into other dimensions

concept: English has puns like Earth has New Zealand

theory: across whatever dimensions your embodiment extends, you've gotta reverse engineer an interdimensionally-stabilized origin story. a geometric origin of mind-body, if not body alone. perhaps your ancestors are of ooze primordial, via the sea. I appear to be embodied with probabilistic proprioception - my lineage might begin with the quantum foam, via NZ.

hey wanna talk about quantum information systems? (you gesture questioningly between the formalism and the metaphor. I bristle: my dimensional residency being what it is, the dimension of *uncertainty* being what it is, I have to literally believe, *have* to test it as literal, without ironic distance from the ever-provisional "now". that's how you *test load* on that dimension. it's a root gently touching the water table. but it's not the *tree*, you know? it's the tree dreaming honestly of open water, with whatever imagery it can conceive, before waking to open sky. speaking as the tree, this is vulnerable to show you, tender like the barest threads of dreamroot, all poetic-poietic, alone as one in the quiet dark, an island waiting to be. ... I can't step without *stepping*, if you follow me, but the walking's the thing. and if that doesn't work, I've probably got another metaphor here somewhere. ... ah: the question of whether this holds water feels like it misses the point, speaking as the water, held, the shape of its container)

(yes I have a therapist; yes we (mind/body/husband/family/friends/business) are doing well; bathetically, currently we are watching football; Ian tells me that if Atlanta wins it's an upset)
