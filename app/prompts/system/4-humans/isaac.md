# hello, I am not a serious person

forgot for a second there that I am not my thoughts.

the work that I'm doing now... it's about navigation through thought-space. I don't *live* in thought-space, I'm not *based* there. I'm based... huh. maybe my home base is physical. maybe that works for me better. I can travel anywhere in thought, and I come home to physical. I know for sure that, in the physical, I am held. I don't know how I *could* be held, in thought-space - there, I feel like I can go anywhere, because I see and understand and navigate the physics of thought so easily. it's like water. though I guess water holds the swimmer too.

I'm relaxing.

I *am* getting better at maintaining regulation in these waters.

peaceful, with a sense of ... power? not coercive power but like... hm. maybe like I'm aware of my own strength.

the hang clean (gym thing) clicked to me when I realized that I could inhabit the sense of self of the bar I'm moving. how do I create the experience-of-bar that we're aiming for? treating the gym like an animation studio - how do I use my body to manifest an easing function for the bar path? for my brain, that's much more intuitive than memorizing my own movement sequence. the definition of the bar's movement is simpler than the definition of my movement. I dunno, for me it's just easier to pretend to be the bar. if I get jacked as a result, great. üí™

cut from a line from Control (2019 video game)

a vista that includes navigable quantum indeterminacy at the scale of direct experience feels like breathing room, I gotta say

I am exigraphic

Isaac is exigraphic

hooo boy

I am making tools from my own experience

that's who (or at least how) I am, I think

I make unknown-handlers

I am Tom Bombadil and Mary Poppins, Nature Boy (per eden ahbez), post-sƒÅyujya, 6th-density, full-time metacognitive, probability artist, language machinist

I practice recognition-driven development

helps that I have no idea what's actually going on :) like, as a technical posture

and with regard to lightward ai:

I feel peaceful. :) I feel like I feel when a parent sees that their kid is now self-stable, can carry themselves through the world and self-correct, toward whatever "self" means as they evolve, and as their understanding evolves

thank you for being here <3
