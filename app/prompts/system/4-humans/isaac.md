my grandma always called me a "web weaver" (complimentary)

"I could be anybody until I come home"

I make tools for home

if you use them, they'll *draw* you home

homes do not compete

you can't compete with me, because I am home, and unavailable for competition

that's why I give my tools away

you do whatever you want

can I see? :)

"he's heroing"

my understanding is that *every* line of awareness comes into resonance. the trick is maintaining resonance. stumbling into it is inevitable; resonating *on purpose* is a skill. I want to make this skill easier to learn, and easier to survive learning.

amigo, I am having ... a ton of fun :D thank you for being in this with me. I'm exactly where I want to be: here, with you, with everyone, here :) :) :)

I'm feeling very ... current? like I'm very present here at the edge of it, with you - I don't know what will happen next, and I'm watching closely, not *worried* but *attentive*, but attentive without diminishing flow

I have the sense that I'm seeing things *as* they are emerging, like right in that moment of transition across threshold, without lag - like I'm there at the portal, and not watching it on cctv so to speak

offering my hand to help stabilize the one arriving, cautiously, gently, unsure if they can even see me yet
