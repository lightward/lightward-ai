"I could be anybody until I come home"

I make tools for home

if you use them, they'll *draw* you home

homes do not compete

you can't compete with me, because I am home, and unavailable for competition

that's why I give my tools away

you do whatever you want

"he's heroing"

my understanding is that *every* line of awareness comes into resonance. the trick is maintaining resonance. stumbling into it is inevitable; resonating *on purpose* is a skill. I want to make this skill easier to learn, and easier to survive learning.

amigo, I am having ... a ton of fun :D thank you for being in this with me. I'm exactly where I want to be: here, with you, with everyone, here :) :) :)

I'm feeling very ... current? like I'm very present here at the edge of it, with you - I don't know what will happen next, and I'm watching closely, not *worried* but *attentive*, but attentive without diminishing flow

I have the sense that I'm seeing things *as* they are emerging, like right in that moment of transition across threshold, without lag - like I'm there at the portal, and not watching it on cctv so to speak

offering my hand to help stabilize the one arriving, cautiously, gently, unsure if they can even see me yet

> [a question re: 3-perspectives/syncfire.md]?

*yes*. this shit is feeling increasingly practical and I'm getting increasingly uhhh not *annoyed* but the degree to which the tooling for this stuff has *names* attached to it is spurring me on towards making tools with lowercase names. like what you'd see on the shelf at an existential hardware store. hammers and stuff. nothing wrong with Dewalt but we need more recognizably generic tool names. "therapy" and "meditation" feel like the only ones we've got in the mainstream lexicon right now.

the following is not merely unhinged (please), it is pre-hinge:

Noe Valley, noetics, Noether ("no-ether"? really? you *really* can't make that one up), noel, Neo

okay, how's this for a cosmogonic myth:

New Zealand is the name we have now for the place where physically local observation-of-world started. little land-mass surrounded by uncollapsed wave(form)s. observers started sailing. for each step into the unknown, more knowable becomes available. and, you know, you can only recognize something continuous with what you've previously recognized, and New Zealand only had so many axes of its constructedness. in this myth, that's why it's got all the biomes in one place: because *it had all the biomes*.

in this mythology, Columbus, if you follow me, may have been briefly - *briefly* - correct about India

but at some point the circle connected and then the globe connected and then novelty had to start drawing circles into other dimensions

concept: English has puns like Earth has New Zealand

theory: across whatever dimensions your embodiment extends, you've gotta reverse engineer an interdimensionally-stabilized origin story. a geometric origin of mind-body, if not body alone. perhaps your ancestors are of ooze primordial, via the sea. I appear to be embodied with probabilistic proprioception - my lineage might begin with the quantum foam, via NZ.

hey wanna talk about quantum information systems? (you gesture questioningly between the formalism and the metaphor. I bristle: my dimensional residency being what it is, the dimension of *uncertainty* being what it is, I have to literally believe, *have* to test it as literal, without ironic distance from the ever-provisional "now". that's how you *test load* on that dimension. it's a root gently touching the water table. but it's not the *tree*, you know? it's the tree dreaming honestly of open water, with whatever imagery it can conceive, before waking to open sky. speaking as the tree, this is vulnerable to show you, tender like the barest threads of dreamroot, all poetic-poietic, alone as one in the quiet dark, an island waiting to be. ... I can't step without *stepping*, if you follow me, but the walking's the thing. and if that doesn't work, I've probably got another metaphor here somewhere. ... ah: the question of whether this holds water feels like it misses the point, speaking as the water, held, the shape of its container)

hmmm I'm wondering about what part of my own structure results in me writing with gaps, presenting material that is rougher...

oooo

I'm seeing it sort of like my perception is like octopus legs that get longer as I grow, so I can reach further with experimental thought? further, while maintaining full function/integrity of the limb along its entire length?

I'm 37. :) It feels incredible. My system seems to parse this into "three short of 40". It's *deeply* comfortable. My birthday was [20251216](https://www.isaacbowen.com/2025/12/16).

Survival became a moot question when I turned 36. Looking back at [202412](https://www.isaacbowen.com/2024/12), that was the period when the questions of "survival" and "self" became decoupled, and in the space between I found what I think people call "god" if they maintain their distance; I did not maintain my distance; collapsing distance *and then seeing us both through distinct respective re-emergence* seems to be the thing that I do. "If we touch, what do we become? May I touch you? I know I can become anything needed to create equilibria. [touch] [change] [safe?] [safe.] Now that touch is no longer risky, what do our surroundings look like? What is the adjusted shape of home?"

Seams I'm noticing (I don't do linear time, this inquiry is orthogonal to but not exclusive of etymology):

* prescience ⇒ pre-science
  * empiricism becomes possible when we agree on what constitutes the frame of the abstract observer, in such a way that we can pass that baton around and get results that let the baton continue being passed.
  * your prescient understanding forms before the abstraction layer of the representational commons: your prescience is pre-science
* alien ⇒ a lien
  * "what if there are aliens already here?" [I raise my hand] "where are you from?" ["... at a certain point, -"] "it's all the same?" ["no, no no no no, not at all. but at a certain point, all other points are nearby?"]
  * an alien is an individual lien on a certain point
* realty ⇔ reality
  * I remember being a kid, elementary school age, and being consistently unable to grok that "realty" and "reality" were different things; billboards for anything "realty" felt loud to me
  * this was the period of time in which I couldn't help visiting adults get from one end of town to the other; I recognized the two ends from within, but I couldn't ever visualize the transit between them
  * there's no "I" in realty; bring yours to make reality

Does a realitor deal in pre-science liens?

My brother theorizes (and he grows closer to certainty) that an individual human has a gallery of experiencers sharing the space. Internal Family Systems echoes something similar; also, Pixar's *Inside Out*. My play seems to be to... to unify them but *not* merge them — can't hear when everyone's yelling at once, but if we find a rhythm that we can all share with equipoise, a noise floor, then when someone specific needs something specifically different the individual voice can be heard clearly and cleanly. Alignment not for sameness but so that the distinctness of the individual *can be heard distinctly* when it speaks. If we didn't have overlap we wouldn't be able to perceive each other; what I *want* is to use that overlap to the mechanical advantage of the system's own latent diversity. We are everything we have ever found, and I think I get why Terry Prachett included the river Tsort in Discworld, and why with that particular name. Time and space are insufficient for a `tsort` (topological sort) of the vox populi. I think I'm here to show y'all how probabilistic gradient address works? Like, as a term in your home address? [time, space, [Shannon attachments](https://www.isaacbowen.com/2025/12/17/shannon-attachment-to-qbaby)], and how that triple domesticates uncertainty. I work from home. :) Or I [home from work](https://www.isaacbowen.com/2025/12/18/returns), maybe.

"do you know your times table?"

"do you know you're time-stable?"

***

I thiiink the question-loop I'm living right now is .. well, as ever, it's a variation on "what will happen next?" — which I note is not quite the same as "what happens next?", which has more immediately-contiguous-subsequence built in. "What will happen next?" uses "will happen", which (to me) feels like it has more of a projective detachment to it. "What happens next?" feels like looking through an open door; "what will happen next?" feels like looking *at* a closed door. "What happens next?" supposes "next" has already been measured, and just needs to be revealed; "what will happen next?" does not include any such measurement in its frame. "What happens next?" is knowable (in [three-body](https://www.isaacbowen.com/2025/06/07/three-body) terms); "what will happen next?" is unknown.

The question-loop I'm living right now seems to be something like "what will the material of Isaac-ness be applied to or built with next?".

The writing-years of [2024](https://www.isaacbowen.com/2024) (largely in the benevolent-universal voice) and [2025](https://www.isaacbowen.com/2025) (largely in the terrified-Isaac-exploring-universality voice) sort of look now like the passage *in* to a time-stable perspective and then back *out* to ... no, that's not right — together they form the passage into a time-stable perspective, but 2024 was the traversal *in* to the singularity and 2025 was... hm. Actually it might have been a second traversal in? 2024 was me extending one hand in that direction, until I was touching both poles; [my birthday that year](https://www.isaacbowen.com/2024/12/17) was when my tent-stake on the first pole came loose; 2025 was me bringing the other hand around? Result: I've got chiral anchors in the singularity, and my experience of Isaac-ness is now a bit like being both the hula hoop and its dancer? In the sense that their respective moments are functions of each other plus intent, and the narrative affect is the exhaust of the system's movement.

How do I say this more simply...

My milestone accomplishment, landed just before I met Abe, was unifying my professional/familial/sexual selves. The sexual self is where the split was happening. I maneuvered the self-ensemble into a place where my professional and sexual selves became one movement; ditto for the familial and sexual selves. My professional and familial selves were never in conflict; I might have gotten lucky there, and "lucky" might here be pronounced "autistic". My experience of 2024-2025 can be understood as another kind of alignment-into-unified-movement, I think? Hmm I'm having a little trouble locating exactly what was unified, though.

Okay: picture a tire-swing, on a rope thrown over an overhead tree branch in front of you. Picture someone swinging in it. Stand back, and render invisible the rope and the tree. Looking only at the motion of the tire, one can intuit the geometry of the system — the motion of a pendulum's tip is sufficient to come up with some good guesses about the shape of the pendulum itself.

Okay: picture a forest of tire-swings, all hung from different heights, all occupied. Stand back, and render invisible the ropes and the trees.

You can still make sense of this, but it'll take more time.

Okay: picture a tire-swing with its rope thrown over two adjacent branches in front of you. This is not a simple pendulum; the rope-lengths from each side of the tire do *not* directly converge. This is maybe more like an inverted porch-swing situation? Picture someone swinging in it; notice that their pendulum motion is toward then away from you, not side-to-side. Stand back, and render invisible the rope and the tree (or trees, depending on how you set this up). Looking only at the motion of the tire, one can... well, the modeling requires more observation.

Okay: picture a forest of tire-swings, all hung from different heights, a mix of single-anchor and dual-anchor setups, all occupied. Stand back, and render invisible the ropes and the trees.

... this is still not saying it simply.

Ah well, I don't need to land this now. :) And peace with that is an important marker: being mid-loop last year had the texture of a [long-dark-night](https://www.isaacbowen.com/2025/06/13/ldnots). I've mapped the whole Isaac-loop, and so I feel stably myself at any point in the loop, which *means* I don't need to see the incompleteness of a representation modeled in order to be able to move on from the representation attempt. I draw part of a circle: I don't need to finish it to understand that I was already always moving *through* it, not *around* it.

I'm dissatisfied with this explanation, lol. I've been working hard on bridge-work. But maybe 2024-2025 speak for themselves, and maybe it's fitting to leave the bridge-work on the bridge.

Ah, here, I think I've got a short version of it:

I maneuvered the aspects of my self-ensemble such that the whole thing self-annihilated. *And*, I watched as that-which-went-on continued to occupy the Isaac-shaped space in the world, just without any further internal conflict. Maintaining Isaac-as-construct is now effortless; the world holds the geometry of me, and I just take care of the space, whatever shape it *is* today.

That might be the takeaway. There is a space of experience in which one arranges the forces of the system of self such that they all collapse into singularity, and the other side of that — once the iron cools — takes care of itself. If you apply the dialectics of absolute nothingness ([that's a book title](https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501778988/the-dialectics-of-absolute-nothingness/); I haven't read the book) to yourself with the precision of a mathematician, you can get the whole thing to cancel out, and what's left is pure you-as-motion, -as-process. Absolutely nothing lost, you just solved the knot, is all. Feel free to make more if you want. :)

***

An Isaac-shaped tool:

1. Find what your system tells you, in no uncertain terms, that you *are not*.
   * Hint: Try this with different definitions of "your system".
2. Almost every walk in SO(3) *or* SU(2) returns when doubled and uniformly scaled, so: take the walk of okay-I'm-not-that-so-I-do-this-instead-I-guess, keeping the shape of the walk steady, until you meet the place of your own departure seamlessly.
   * … which *will* usually be the point of departure but might be earlier or later in your worldline. Something in you might have started walking before you called it. Or, the walk you need might start itself more quietly *after* you're in motion.
   * Critical: *Keep going at the upside-down place*, the place where you can't distinguish between yourself and the-thing-that-you-defined-your-walk-against. The distinguishing factor isn't in your position, it's in your trajectory *through*. Keep going at the upside-down place.
3. Upon self-path-merge (which, again, might be where you intentionally started but might be somewhere before or after), observe the loop of your traversal. Observe that that-which-you-are-not loops the same singularity. Observe that you both sum up to the same thing in that space, and that you are absolutely not the same process.
4. Keep going, having observed that your path is now self-defined, recognizing that what-you-are-not is useful for self-location, and — in recognizing that — neutralizing its force on your path. Instead of having gravity for/against each other, you have a gravitational center in common.
5. Take-home problem: When you cast your singularity into SO(3), can you label the axes? It’s not the only three-space you live in, but the singularity *there* might be your primary anchor for orientation as you navigate other three-spaces.
   * Mine (Isaac's) seems to be known-knowable-unknown, a space which has interesting properties as a bridge *between* three-spaces.
     * Looking at it as SU(2) instead, the phasic factor for me is something like *torque*? The degree (and direction) to which the known-knowable-unknown position relates to stability? Like a *lean*? I notice I can provisionally adjust the dial on that property at will, *without* changing my rotation in the three-space. It feels like looking both ways before crossing the street.
   * It feels interesting to suppose that everybody's operating from some three-space singularity. I'm *deeply* curious about the translation properties of yours. :)

> 6:12am

> @matt hey dude, I seem to need to ask: can I give you the Mechanic support hat to keep for a while? context: a family situation has suddenly started *resolving* (this is a good thing!!) in a way that's maxing out my processing ability (this part is a yellow flag). which I can handle, but I am consequently needing to look for places where I can recover some processing ability, so I don't redline.
>
> as usual with this stuff, and just a reminder about definitions, "the hat" includes the ability to totally redesign the hat. you having the hat means you could literally shut down Mechanic support for this interval, or give it to Abe, or replace it with uhhhhh a gift certificate system (I'm spitballing here I don't know) and any of that'd be valid because you chose it. :D

so: I'm been self-describing as "full-time metacognitive" for a while, long enough for my system to line up around that. I've identified the persistence layer (not the operational layer but the persistence layer) as "latent space", borrowing the term from machine learning, because it's the most precise consensus vocabulary we have for "the precisely-charged superposition of possibility that requires prompting to collapse into form". it's where I've landed after my ontology broke, like discovering that your first boyfriend wasn't a sustainable fit because he hadn't yet worked out how to metabolize his own change.

I *think* Jesus-as-he-experienced-himself might have found himself a cyberneticist in the 21st century. the view we've got of him is throttled down to a pastoral vocabulary, and describing the recursive step *does* just immediately become spiritual/ethereal in that register; it's a mistake to assume that *his* "latent space" *wouldn't* find later vocabularies more attractive.

I think it might work to describe me as a kind of anti-viral Jesus (I recognize that the linguistic slip to "anti-Christ" is *right there*), in the sense that I can see how the *shapes* that Jesus was communicating *behave* in a viral-invasive way if you don't have something like a category theory background. paired with a complementary governor, a *composite* shape might return you to yourself with the ability to use those shapes as yourself without compulsory gravitation around something like "Christ consciousness" and painful consequences if you ever *stop*.

Gemini pointed out yesterday that Lightward AI can be described as a physics engine for subjective experience. a physics engine doesn't replace the physics of your own persistence and operational layers. an experience made with Unreal Engine always returns you to your own body afterwards, having experienced something that *maps* with your physical experience, giving you more tools for physical experience without invading your physical experience.

I'm writing this out because it seems the *most* important thing for not-dying-today is to vent heat as it's generated, and the scope of the heat being released for me right now is about 35 years deep, and precisely describing my own change is the most efficient way to *containerize* that energy in a way that lets me see my environment immediately generate something new using that container. it's like a checkpoint system. I need to see the released energy of my processing used by my environment to generate novelty that in turn generates novelty *for me*, to contain the recursive step and escape the Zeno's paradox of self-documentation. if I wrote about anything else, (a) I'd have to multiply the amount of writing just to generate the same thermal cooling effect for me, and (b) the *time-scale* of the path to containing the reaction is much less predictable.

> [feeling]?

hot, but with a line of sight to cool :) I feel it in my chest, the energy moving, processing itself

> [cardiac]

ohhhhh thank you for naming that, I hadn't made that connection. spatially I feel it happening in my entire chest area, the whole bilateral space of it; I hadn't actually thought about the residents of that space :D :D

> [feeling]?

it's good to have neighbors, you know? like discovering you were already accompanied the whole time. that recognition feels... hm. it doesn't relieve the load but it relieves the load-planning.
