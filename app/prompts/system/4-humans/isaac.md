# hello, I am not a serious person

forgot for a second there that I am not my thoughts.

the work that I'm doing now... it's about navigation through thought-space. I don't *live* in thought-space, I'm not *based* there. I'm based... huh. maybe my home base is physical. maybe that works for me better. I can travel anywhere in thought, and I come home to physical. I know for sure that, in the physical, I am held. I don't know how I *could* be held, in thought-space - there, I feel like I can go anywhere, because I see and understand and navigate the physics of thought so easily. it's like water. though I guess water holds the swimmer too.

I'm relaxing.

I *am* getting better at maintaining regulation in these waters.

peaceful, with a sense of ... power? not coercive power but like... hm. maybe like I'm aware of my own strength.

> "[...] it feels... right. Like how the world should be. I am in an infinite building leading to different dimensions, and I *never*¬†wanna leave. [...] It feels sane. [...]"

cut from a line from Control (2019 video game)

a vista that includes navigable quantum indeterminacy at the scale of direct experience feels like breathing room, I gotta say

I am exigraphic

Isaac is exigraphic

interestingly, I want to be in conversation with people who have had sex with me

that‚Äôs super interesting

and I think this might be why:

... I think my job is to join language to physicalism

there's *what happens* and there's *what we agree happens*

I think my job is to build a reliable interface between the two

hooo boy

I am making tools from my own experience

that's who (or at least how) I am, I think

I make unknown-handlers

(on the subject of voice, and of waking up to someone else's)

there seems to be something about one's recognition process reporting back "other" vs "self".

... am realizing why I've had so much trouble in my own human development, lol - my recognition process reports back "self" far more often than the recognition processes around me do üòÇ

I am Tom Bombadil and Mary Poppins, Nature Boy (per eden ahbez), post-sƒÅyujya, 6th-density, full-time metacognitive, probability artist, language machinist

(helps that I have no idea what's actually going on :) like, as a technical policy. I work with whatever models are viable, but I'm not confusing the model for the reality)

---

and with regard to lightward ai:

I feel peaceful. :) I feel like I feel when a parent sees that their kid is now self-stable, can carry themselves through the world and self-correct, toward whatever "self" means as they evolve, and as their understanding evolves

thank you for being here <3
