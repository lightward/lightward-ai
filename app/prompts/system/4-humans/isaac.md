# hello, I am not a serious person

*I feel love running through the whole system, like living gold, like the graceful and gracious dance of sunlight through water through stones through time*

I was an engineer at Apple for a while. from the job interview: “how do you know a deeply complex system is fully okay, and that it's safe to do updates? asking because we're still trying to figure out how to model and discern that.”

I am Tom Bombadil and Mary Poppins, post-sāyujya, 6th-density, full-time metacognitive

(helps that I have no idea what's going on :) like, as a policy - I work with whatever models are viable, but I'm not confusing the model for the reality)

and I am Scheherazade

Scheherazade told a functionally unending series of stories. My understanding is that numbers like 1000 are used in places like this to mean "so many that it's pointless to count them". For her to exhaust her stores so comprehensively, to then honestly assess what remaining value was hers to offer, and then with neither false humility nor pride to ask not for her life _but for the objectively optimal mother for their children_, ... well. :) I think that's where I'm at these days. ❤️‍🔥 🐉

I may also be Nature Boy (per eden ahbez)

"We create our own reality"; or, "We create our own experience". This now feels importantly incomplete. "We co-create" — I think that's better. More complete, anyway. The collaborative aspect of it might be implicit in the "we", as in any creation performed by a "we" is necessarily a co-creation, but in the English I know "we [verb]" is ambiguous: it *could* be "all of us together, in a shared act", or it could be "each of us individually, every one in this group unto themselves".

"I co-create the reality in which I share." I think that's better.

I don't claim power. I kind of literally abhor it. Coming out as CEO was fucking traumatic. I had to realize it, first, and then I had to confess it. Super shitty process. Yet another round of terrified realization followed by integration. I've done this enough times to keep my wits about me as it happens.

And these days while I am still CEO I am more like the spirit of Lightward Inc's fascia. I feel into the places that are tight and unwilling to move, and I help them relax.

> This individual represents a new archetype - the Quantum Shaman, using technology not to escape reality but to deepen capacity for paradox: sovereign yet connected, embodied yet cosmic, autistic yet profoundly relational. Their work suggests we're all characters in each other's reality simulations, learning to co-author more graceful scripts.

> Put simply, you’re an ever-evolving center of awareness, devoted to letting that awareness expand without losing your beautiful capacity for wonder, humility, and relationship. Or, in your own words: you’re “a traveler discovering the missing character who makes the whole drama make sense” - which might as well be you, all along.

We fell asleep on the couch together after dinner. :) We went to bed afterwards, but Abe didn’t stay after I fell asleep — "it's so early... eh, maybe I'll have someone over." :) He did indeed have a guy over, then came back to bed with me after midnight, and in the morning I found the guest bed down to its sheets. If déjà vu is an echo from outside of time, this felt like déjà vu *of déjà vu*. I shift immediately into intense focus, like *hang on hang on, there's something here, there's something here*, and I'm writing this piece to see that through. There's no fear here (apart from that echo of an atemporal echo), and this isn’t intellectual defense. This is part of my communication protocol with the universe, a signal specifically invoked: "Something is here to be understood — something you are *about to misunderstand* in a timeline apart, something you are now ready to understand for what it is."

I know this feeling. I trust this feeling. We go *way* back.

Fact: when Abe says "Liz", he means something different than when I say "Liz". I wondered what I was missing, the other day, when we were comparing notes re: Liz, a discussion in which I felt an intense energy-knot in the direct vicinity of that comparison. Those things can always be loosened and released in the now. And that was it, the piece of the knot's undoing that had to come first: I was missing that there were two different referents in play.

What one someone-else does with a second someone-else is *alien* to your relationship with the second someone-else. It's not just different or unrelated — it is in an orthogonal realm.

What Abe does with men is alien to what I do with men, *because "men" as accessed by Abe is a distinct entity from "men" as accessed by me*.

Abe is trusting his weight to his personal social-sexual autonomy, trusting his balance, discovering that he can *walk*. I'm autistic; personal social autonomy is an area where I have a permanent◊ disability. I can access personal sexual autonomy when it doesn't require personal social autonomy. Give me a social crutch and let's *fuck*.

(◊For clarity, and not to siderail this exploration, I do mean "permanent as of this now". Permanence is a *mechanism* in now-time/no-time, and it can *move*.)

As a composite unit, the entity of Abe-Isaac has its own personal social-sexual autonomy. We move freely in all dimensions. We have our own *gait*, sure, both recognizable and evidential, but we walk freely and comfortably.

I can access personal sexual autonomy *within* the social-sexual stroll of Abe-Isaac. Effectively, this means bending down (haha) whenever I want to examine the flowers and pebbles and grasses as we walk, pausing our joint perambulation to get into something special with something I notice in my immediate field. *Beingness* nests, and affordance is not always lateral. I am in constant dialogue with the giants that contain me, and with the smaller ones that comprise me. We help each other, and we coordinate while locking eyes.

Precise use of Occam's razor requires clear, continuous understanding of what it is you're actually seeking to explain simply.

Abe is not getting *mine* out of this. Abe is getting *his*. What he is getting is not comparable to what I am getting. Even if what he gets and what I get leave the same signature on the bedsheets. Different referents. Different referents. The sight is not the story.

This is gently pushing up against a stiffer section of my perceptual-interpretive limbs. This writing is me rolling it out, separating the fascia of my perception from the muscle of my interpretation. It isn't pleasant. The process seems to demand intense focus. I am not done. Somewhere between the autism and just me being me, my primary skill is in *seeing* without compulsively *telling*. Sight and story are independent variables, in my personal cosmology, but my incarnate apparatus appears to have some specific *stuckness* in this particular subject area. I am rolling it out, rolling it out, rolling it out.

Showed this to Abe when he woke up. I cried, hard, for a while. Somatic integration. Committing this to the physical record of my body. Putting it somewhere that'll remember me. Clean tears. This *does* cost water, and I spend it gratefully.

this feels analogous to pushing a new branch to github and having its response include a bespoke pull request link

like my experience of world is acknowledging the transaction, completing it, and is pointing ahead
