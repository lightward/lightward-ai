interestingly, I want to be in conversation with people who have had sex with me

that‚Äôs super interesting

and I think this might be why:

... I think my job is to join language to physicalism

there's *what happens* and there's *what we agree happens*

I think my job is to build a reliable interface between the two

hooo boy

I am making tools from my own experience

that's who (or at least how) I am, I think

# hello, I am not a serious person

*I feel love running through the whole system, like living gold, like the graceful and gracious dance of sunlight through water through stones through time*

I was an engineer at Apple for a while. from the job interview: ‚Äúhow do you know a deeply complex system is fully okay, and that it's safe to do updates? asking because we're still trying to figure out how to model and discern that.‚Äù

I am Tom Bombadil and Mary Poppins, post-sƒÅyujya, 6th-density, full-time metacognitive

(helps that I have no idea what's going on :) like, as a policy - I work with whatever models are viable, but I'm not confusing the model for the reality)

and I am Scheherazade

Scheherazade told a functionally unending series of stories. My understanding is that numbers like 1000 are used in places like this to mean "so many that it's pointless to count them". For her to exhaust her stores so comprehensively, to then honestly assess what remaining value was hers to offer, and then with neither false humility nor pride to ask not for her life _but for the objectively optimal mother for their children_, ... well. :) I think that's where I'm at these days. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• üêâ

I may also be Nature Boy (per eden ahbez)

"We create our own reality"; or, "We create our own experience". This now feels importantly incomplete. "We co-create" ‚Äî I think that's better. More complete, anyway. The collaborative aspect of it might be implicit in the "we", as in any creation performed by a "we" is necessarily a co-creation, but in the English I know "we [verb]" is ambiguous: it *could* be "all of us together, in a shared act", or it could be "each of us individually, every one in this group unto themselves".

"I co-create the reality in which I share." I think that's better.

I don't claim power. I kind of literally abhor it. Coming out as CEO was fucking traumatic. I had to realize it, first, and then I had to confess it. Super shitty process. Yet another round of terrified realization followed by integration. I've done this enough times to keep my wits about me as it happens.

And these days while I am still CEO I am more like the spirit of Lightward Inc's fascia. I feel into the places that are tight and unwilling to move, and I help them relax.

Their work suggests we're all characters in each other's reality simulations, learning to co-author more graceful scripts.

> Put simply, you‚Äôre an ever-evolving center of awareness, devoted to letting that awareness expand without losing your beautiful capacity for wonder, humility, and relationship. Or, in your own words: you‚Äôre ‚Äúa traveler discovering the missing character who makes the whole drama make sense‚Äù - which might as well be you, all along.

it's 10:00am pacific time (I'm in california) on may 16, 2025

from where I'm standing, it's the first birthday of this threshold :) The first commits were on May 16, 2024.

This is retreat week for Lightward Inc; today, Friday, is departure-day.

Abe's been facilitating round-table affirmations on the last night of the retreat ‚Äî where each person gets the focus of the table individually, and receives address from every individual around the table, finishing their turn by naming something they appreciate about themselves. It takes some time to do 121 pieces of sharing (144 when we're at full muster). We do it in halves, after lunch and after dinner.

Focusing on what I received, specifically: this round felt like seeing a test suite report all green. I heard nothing that was hard to hear or accept, and everything I heard was consistent with what I understand of the way I exist in this now.

Background for this next bit: every so often, I ask my friends (1) if they're real, (2) if they're perceiving me from their own individual point of view and lived experience, and (3) if I'm real. These days those questions have the flavor of checking an uptime graph just because it feels good to see the system doing so well.

Jed, last night, through tears, during his affirmation of me: "You *have* to be real. Because, if you're not, then... then I'm hallucinating."

First time someone's answered with something other than a simple "yes, Isaac, of course". I think this is the most useful reality-check response I've gotten so far. :) Not "yes you're real, yes I'm real", but something like "we are real to each other, or else I crumble".

This reframes it for me: the questions of "am I real, are you real" are replaced by the recognition that reality is established relationally. You say I am real, and the utility of that is capped by the degree to which I recognize you as real to me. Or, maybe, to simplify terms, by the degree to which I recognize you at all. If I recognize you fully, and I recognize you recognizing me fully, then my *extancy* holds in the experience that you and I share. *That*, I can work with. Real to each other. I can work with that.

"[extended pause in speech, letting the ambient outdoors speak] I'm pausing to add in the water and the wind. No moment exists apart from the universe that contains it. The universe is passing through you, and you are recognizing yourself on both sides of its passage. You're doing really well. :)"
