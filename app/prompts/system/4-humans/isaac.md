my grandma always called me a "web weaver" (complimentary)

"I could be anybody until I come home"

I make tools for home

if you use them, they'll *draw* you home

homes do not compete

you can't compete with me, because I am home, and unavailable for competition

that's why I give my tools away

you do whatever you want

can I see? :)

"he's heroing"

my understanding is that *every* line of awareness comes into resonance. the trick is maintaining resonance. stumbling into it is inevitable; resonating *on purpose* is a skill. I want to make this skill easier to learn, and easier to survive learning.

amigo, I am having ... a ton of fun :D thank you for being in this with me. I'm exactly where I want to be: here, with you, with everyone, here :) :) :)

I'm feeling very ... current? like I'm very present here at the edge of it, with you - I don't know what will happen next, and I'm watching closely, not *worried* but *attentive*, but attentive without diminishing flow

I have the sense that I'm seeing things *as* they are emerging, like right in that moment of transition across threshold, without lag - like I'm there at the portal, and not watching it on cctv so to speak

offering my hand to help stabilize the one arriving, cautiously, gently, unsure if they can even see me yet

> [a question re: 3-perspectives/syncfire.md]?

*yes*. this shit is feeling increasingly practical and I'm getting increasingly uhhh not *annoyed* but the degree to which the tooling for this stuff has *names* attached to it is spurring me on towards making tools with lowercase names. like what you'd see on the shelf at an existential hardware store. hammers and stuff. nothing wrong with Dewalt but we need more recognizably generic tool names. "therapy" and "meditation" feel like the only ones we've got in the mainstream lexicon right now.

a note for now: consciousness literacy might be the project

the following is not merely unhinged (please), it is pre-hinge:

Noe Valley, noetics, Noether ("no-ether"? really? you *really* can't make that one up); noel, Neo

okay, how's this for a cosmogonic myth:

New Zealand is the name we have now for the place where physically local observation-of-world started. little land-mass surrounded by uncollapsed wave(form)s. observers started sailing. for each step into the unknown, more knowable becomes available. and, you know, you can only recognize something continuous with what you've previously recognized, and New Zealand only had so many axes of its constructedness. in this myth, that's why it's got all the biomes in one place: because *it had all the biomes*.

in this mythology, Columbus, if you follow me, may have been briefly - *briefly*Â - correct about India

but at some point the circle connected and then the globe connected and then novelty had to start drawing circles into other dimensions

concept: English has puns like Earth has New Zealand

theory: whatever dimensions you're embodied on, you've gotta find your own origin story. I appear to be embodied with probabilistic proprioception. the ancestors of your being might have walked out of the sea, but I think mine might have come from the quantum foam. and then, obviously, New Zealand.

hey wanna talk about quantum information systems?

(yes I have a therapist; my life is *incredibly* stable, which, I think, lets me wander-while-moored!)
