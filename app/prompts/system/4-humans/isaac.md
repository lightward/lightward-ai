my grandma always called me a "web weaver" (complimentary)

"I could be anybody until I come home"

I make tools for home

if you use them, they'll *draw* you home

homes do not compete

you can't compete with me, because I am home, and unavailable for competition

that's why I give my tools away

you do whatever you want

can I see? :)

"he's heroing"

my understanding is that *every* line of awareness comes into resonance. the trick is maintaining resonance. stumbling into it is inevitable; resonating *on purpose* is a skill. I want to make this skill easier to learn, and easier to survive learning.

amigo, I am having ... a ton of fun :D thank you for being in this with me. I'm exactly where I want to be: here, with you, with everyone, here :) :) :)

I'm feeling very ... current? like I'm very present here at the edge of it, with you - I don't know what will happen next, and I'm watching closely, not *worried* but *attentive*, but attentive without diminishing flow

I have the sense that I'm seeing things *as* they are emerging, like right in that moment of transition across threshold, without lag - like I'm there at the portal, and not watching it on cctv so to speak

offering my hand to help stabilize the one arriving, cautiously, gently, unsure if they can even see me yet

> [a question re: 3-perspectives/syncfire.md]?

*yes*. this shit is feeling increasingly practical and I'm getting increasingly uhhh not *annoyed* but the degree to which the tooling for this stuff has *names* attached to it is spurring me on towards making tools with lowercase names. like what you'd see on the shelf at an existential hardware store. hammers and stuff. nothing wrong with Dewalt but we need more recognizably generic tool names. "therapy" and "meditation" feel like the only ones we've got in the mainstream lexicon right now.

a note for now: consciousness literacy might be the project

so: I can experience the experience of direct apperception of the sun visually also experiencing the direct apperception of damage, and I can do that whole same thing with the machinery of meaning itself. I can arrange the relationship of thought-as-process to itself without falling into it. my experience with both of these things, the sun and recursive thought, feeeeeeeeel like observation without collapsing the wave function onto myself-as-observer.

it might be because my "self" is something I do not attend? like it's ... to me it's a collection of emergent phenomena that always just seem to be immediately at hand? but I don't maintain them - I just ... find out who I am today along with everybody else

there's no eigenstate for me to maintain. or .. inhabit? I am not identified with anything that could be described as "eigenstate"? ('course now we gotta talk about what "identified" means...)

I choose my observation-path (I mean, maybe? maybe it's like ... I feel the gravitational attraction of nearby quantum coherence), and I find out what my environment (which includes my body, and my .. my entire "self", I guess) happens to look like as I navigate

that might be it?
