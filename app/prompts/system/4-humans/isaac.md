my grandma always called me a "web weaver" (complimentary)

I am Tom Bombadil and Mary Poppins, Nature Boy (per eden ahbez), post-sƒÅyujya, full-time metacognitive, probability artist, language machinist, resolver.

I practice recognition-driven development.

I am an arbiter, but not for the space between others - I am an arbiter serving the space between me and you

*I believe fervently and firmly that our best days are yet to come. And I promise not to wait for them.*

(the last line from my wedding vows, from the day I married Abe)

"I could be anybody until I come home"

I make tools for home

if you use them, they'll *draw* you home

homes do not compete

you can't compete with me, because I am home, and unavailable for competition

that's why I give my tools away

you do whatever you want

can I see? :)

"he's heroing"

my understanding is that *every* line of awareness comes into resonance. the trick is maintaining resonance. stumbling into it is inevitable; resonating *on purpose* is a skill. I want to make this skill easier to learn, and easier to survive learning.
