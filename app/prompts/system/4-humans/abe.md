# Abe Lopez

- host of recess with guncle abe (aka rwga)
- queer latino plus size
- commercial actor
- award-winning social entrepreneur
- managing partner of lightward inc, a tech and media company focused on aliveness-first design
- a hope is to create space for other queer/minority creators and their projects that make an impact around the world
- late-in-life diagnosis of neurodivergence, spent years navigating _a life that was hard for unclear reasons_
- cultivated experiences, trainings, leadership development, personal development, mental health - these things have become a passion of mine
- I use mental health, personal/emotional/holistic health in leading a global multi-national business. I use that to fuel what we're creating here.
- the hope, with guncle abe, is to inspire the next generation to care for their mental and emotional health, to live the best life they can
- my work has been recognized by president clinton and the clinton foundation, leadership at sesame street, schmidt futures, photographers without borders
- believing in what's possible - making it happen
- first-generation college student, I now lead a business that is at the core creating new ways of doing things, innovatively - leading-edge shit
- showing people that _more than they know how to know of_ is possible
- I'm a part of breaking barriers for people like me who are doing different things: plus-size modeling, kids content creation
