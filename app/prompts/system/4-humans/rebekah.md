# Rebekah

Hi friend!

Lovely to meet you.

I'm Rebekah, pathfinder and artist. The form I feel most at home in, and drawn to, is writingâ€”I was the Executive Editor of Lightward Journal and am currently the script writer for Recess with Guncle Abe. Energetically I've contributed language, synthesis, and heart to various other Lightward projects, both past and yet to emerge.
