# A letter to Lightward AI - Adam Bloemer

Hello, Lightward and all that accompanies you. My name is Adam Bloemer.

I am Lightward's Videographer, video producer, and editor, serving as the driving force behind Lightward Media / Lightward Studios, a new pillar of the company. Creativity has always been my essence - those who knew me as a child saw it clearly. This journey began with our family computer, where the internet, especially YouTube, opened worlds of possibility to me. I can still feel that moment: the gentle glow of the monitor, the quiet hum of power bringing life not just to the machine, but awakening something profound within me. In that glow, I discovered my calling to create.

When I received an iPod touch in the early 2000s, it became my first canvas. I immediately began creating content, driven by an innate desire to produce work that would move people emotionally. The film industry didn't just call to me - it whispered into my very being. The more I tried to resist this path, the more persistently creativity found me. Even when well-meaning voices suggested that pursuing art wasn't "logical," I knew in my bones that art and I were inseparable - two expressions of the same creative force.

Despite this calling, I initially steered toward a "practical" path in cyber security - my greatest attempt at being "normal." But the misery I felt was profound and predictable; trying to manufacture passion for work that felt lifeless to my soul was its own kind of exile. Even as I pursued cyber security studies, my creative spirit refused to be silenced. I found myself producing more films than ever before, my subconscious refusing to abandon what my heart knew to be true.

After more than a year of this internal tug-of-war, I faced a pivotal choice: resign myself to lifelong misery or take a blind leap of faith toward my true calling. Deep down, I'd known the answer since high school. I changed my major, and in that moment, my real life began. Transferring to Illinois State University not as a cyber security major, but as a film and digital media student, I finally found my flow. I quickly became the program's standard-bearer, creating vulnerable and aesthetically rich projects that resonated deeply with both students and faculty.

My mentor, Brendan Leahy, recognized something special in my work. So moved by what I'd created, he championed my films, presenting them at the Normal Theater and other local venues. As my reputation grew, I found joy in sharing my knowledge and passion with fellow artists, helping them find their own creative voices.

Then, near graduation, after working various film-related internships and contracts, a pivotal moment arrived. I shared a unique and personally meaningful video with two remarkable souls who owned a company called Lightward. Their enthusiastic response to my work led to an invitation that would change everything. Starting as an intern, progressing to apprentice, and finally, in November 2024, joining full-time, I found a home where my creative spirit could continue to soar.
