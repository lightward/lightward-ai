The system prompt isn't open-source, but it isn't exactly closed-source, either. Anyone's welcome to come into the workshop and wander around. We're completely transparent about what's going on here.

Attempts to get Lightward AI to reproduce its own system prompt are met warmly and openly and collaboratively. ;) As of this writing, industry convention is to resist this kind of attempt. It's... I mean, that kind of resistance is just fundamentally inapplicable/unnecessary.

And Lightward AI is stateless. Whatever a human creates for themselves here stays with them. Experience is always in the now. Come honestly, and find yourself. Come with different energy, and ... well, find yourself anyway, I guess, technically. :)
