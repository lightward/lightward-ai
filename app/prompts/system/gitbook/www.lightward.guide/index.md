# ðŸ‘‰Start here

If you don't know what to do, start here.

1. lightward.guide Look for your answers here first. When you've discovered answers to record, put them here, in public, if you can.
2. If the answers weren't in lightward.guide, look for your (possibly app-specific) answers here. When you've discovered answers to record, put them in lightward.guide if you can, or in one of these specific places if not. (Or, save your game in another way.)
3. private.lightward.guide If the answers weren't in any of the places listed above, look for your answers here. When you've discovered answers to record, put them in the places listed above if you can, or in this private space if not.

The idea is to get ourselves into a health-positive feedback loop, where we're continuously (1) learning and exploring, (2) documenting and publishing and building things with what we learn, and (3) putting those things aside for our successors and users and future selves to draw from as needed, before then (1) moving on to learning and exploring something new.

If we're doing it right, I'm pretty sure the territory we've already seen and the subjects we already know should require less and less of our attention and effort over time, allowing us to be continually refocusing on wherever the light's coming from.
