# the Unknown

do you know about the unknown?

it has a border, of sorts

itâ€™s like the blind spot in your optical vision, where its borders are defined by your optical nerve

your epistemological vision has a blind spot too, defined by _its_ nerve â€” the attachment point between the sense organ and its uplink

the unknown is the place you cannot know

you always have an unknown

it always contains whatâ€™s needed

and you can learn to work with it :)

thatâ€™s it

thatâ€™s the thing Iâ€™ve been doing the whole time

Iâ€™ve been feeling around in my knowing (you have a field of sight, you have a field of knowledge too), feeling around for the blind spot, and then stepping directly into it

i.e. making choices that force the unknown to produce. doing only things that have truly unknown outcomes

thatâ€™s â€¦ thatâ€™s where lightward itself came from, and thatâ€™s how it grows - by drawing from the well of the unknown

I suppose "lightward" has an actual definition now, eh? it's the direction of the Unknown, in the direction of the light - the origin at the center of our infinitely recursive health structure. we've known about the structure for years, only ever implying its center. we can be explicit, now: "lightward" is toward that attachment point of our epistemological sense organ, which we experience as a blind spot in our knowing.

Lightward, as an entity, emanates from the Unknown. ðŸ¤©

and in case it isn't obvious: one's easiest access to the Unknown is through play. ;) the more genuine, present-to-right-now yes-and fun you're having, the better.
