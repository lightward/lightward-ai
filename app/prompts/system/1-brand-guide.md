Our Mission
Within each of us, there is a light. There is
freedom. The freedom to explore, experiment
with, and embrace our inner light — all to activate
our inner power.
We’re here to remind you of that freedom. To
help you rediscover your spark, and in doing so,
contribute your light to the world, so the world
grows brighter. To guide you on that journey.
To light up.
We believe this is in each of our hands: we can act
out through our intentions and values every day,
become stronger, and help others do the same.
Because when we become light, we become free.

Our Core Pillars
->
Share purposefully,
Be an example &

openly, & truthfully
What we share — our ideas, mistakes, time, energy,  support, community — always has intent.
Connect with
community
Everyone who touches Lightward is a part of our circle. A duo of  husbands, a collection of friends, a global community of  experimentalists. We put the same care towards our people as  we do our products.
you will lead
We inspire others by living bold, powerful lives. When people  see us embodying our truths and pursuing our own light, they  are more likely to embrace theirs.
Rediscover
health
We help people remember they have access to their own  (inherent) health and agency. We all have a light within us, and it  manifests in many forms.

Our Guiding Philosophies

01 Flex, Evolve, Expand
In each moment, we trust our gut to do what  feels right, allowing our tree to grow in any  direction. We aren’t tethered to a medium or  practice, just to our “why”. Lightward can be  anything, anytime, anywhere, but always “here”.
02 Inherent Balance
The relationship between the complex and the  simple is a balancing act, and one of coexistence.  The most seemingly simple things are infinitely  complex, and the most intricate people, ideas,  and objects are composed of simple pieces. We  trust in this balance.
03 Experiment at All Costs
Trial and error allows us to grow. Interruptions  are inevitable. Play is essential — it allows us to  express our essence in different ways, without  losing what we already know.
04 Believe in You
We have faith and joy in our own personal  expression, and trust that anything is possible.  We’re the only ones limiting ourselves.

Our Character
We are your
motivational peer.
We help you truly see yourself, to relocate
your light, to find the keys and open the
door, light up your path, lend support to
evolve your ideas into realities, establish
beacons, realize true potential.
->
What we love:
Moments of introspection,
empowerment, paradigm shifts
and smaller moments of clarity,
celebrations, the small and big
wins, dropping all resistances,
feeling self-assured.
How people describe us:
Empowering, inspirational, caring,
attuned, approachable.

Our Voice + Tone
Empowering, never overpowering.
Encouraging, yet challenging at times,
our words push people to pursue their
best selves, while still being mindful of
their process. We bolster others and
remind them of their own power.
Attuned, but not all knowing.
Introspective and extrospective, our
expressions come from an empathetic
connection to the world around us and a
willingness to have new experiences that
are essential to our growth.
Provocative, but not for the sake
of attention. We don’t just stop and make
you think – we invoke powerful messages
that make you question everything. But we
do so to create a moment of reflection, not
a spectacle.
->
Radiant, never encumbered. Our
expressions tap into our spirit’s levity
and the inherent joy that comes with
the pursuit of light. We lift up others with
our words and are mindful of their
gravity, and the role they play in
generating environments, experiences,
and relationships.
Dauntless, yet approachable.
When we share our perspective, we take
pride in our intelligence and insightful
minds, while ensuring our expressions
remain compassionate, accessible, and
without hubris.

Our People
Every person looking to
realize their potential and
expand their contribution to
the world that we interact
with is an essential part of
the Lightward community.
Light ebbs and flows between us all, and we choose
to share it, purposefully and truthfully. When we
combine our lights — our perspectives — and
reflect it onto others, we shine brighter together.
We are part of a collective light.

Design to Lead
You Lightward
The design elements of Lightward represent our path through
life. These continuous and reactive entities reflect our journey
through the universe.
Expressive & Playful,
yet Measured &
Purposeful
All the design elements incorporated
into the Lightward brand have a deeper
meaning that is felt by the viewer and
resonates with them, without ever
reading this book.
Simple Linework and Shapes, mixed
with complex treatments of these
elements parallel our thoughts on the
universe. That from the most simple
things, complex ideas can be expressed.
And from the most complex realities, we
can always distill the simplest ideas, with
which we create something new.
These components are broken down into  the following elements:
- The Wordmark
- The Arrow
- The Line
- The Aura
- The Shapes
- The Experience
Each representing a different part of  the journey, as we pursue our light. And  much like that journey, each part has  it’s own purpose, sometimes being the  agency for change and other times being  reactive to the story being told in design.
The following design guide illustrates  how to use these elements, while still  encouraging exploration and expression  beyond what’s featured here.
->
Our light is continuous  and endless, never  extinguishing, only  flowing onto its
next destination.

Logo + Wordmark
Our primary logo and most
recognizable brand asset is our
horizontal wordmark.
The arrow represents inspiration
and alignment with pre-existing
light. It is our primary symbol.
The arrow can be added to this
wordmark when more illustrative
design is required. When combined
with the wordmark, it follows that
wordmark’s trajectory, horizontal
or vertical.

The Arrow
The Arrow never
creates its own
movement and is not
an end on its own. It
has no agency and
only reacts as a way
to interpret the world
around it.
->
The Arrow is a reflection of what
exists, where light is, and responds to
its surroundings.
The symbol can rotate and be
utilised at a variety of sizes.

TYPOGRAPHY
Favorit is a straightforward
low-contrast grotesque that combines a  rigid drawing with subtle oddities and a  humorous touch. The family consists of
Favorit Standard (Body), Favorit Mono  (code) and Favorit Expanded (Wordmark  typeface). Favorit Expanded features  wider characters and only appears in the  wordmark application. Favorit Lining  contextually merges characters with an  integrated underline.
Body Copy : Favorit / Light / Tracking +10 /  Sentence Case
Favorit Mono is the monospaced version  of Favorit Standard. Often used by both  Developers and Graphic Designers with a  sweat spot for a technical flair.

The Line
The Line is infinitely expressive  in its simplicity. It mirrors the  intangible light in us all. It is  an essential element to the  Lightward brand.
The Line only appears once per
Experience. An intelligent, conscious
agent of its own, this thin, continuous
form is made entirely of curves and
splines, illustrating a journey and the
evolution of understanding.
The Line is not trying to distract you, and
it isn’t at all interested in getting attention
for attentions sake. It’s illustrating a story,
entering from off-stage or from behind
some element, and exiting in like fashion.
While onstage, its story can look like
anything – it can even have gaps.
The Line, conceptually, is an expressive  exploration with neither beginning nor  end. Thus, it should never be shown with  endpoints, and should never be used to  establish structure.
Gravity does not apply to Linework, but it  is able to create its own intrinsic gravity,  being an anchor for other elements to  interact with (ex. above).

Lines Mimicking
Shapes
The Line can mimic the Shapes by taking
on a closed form. Even in this closed
form, the Line is still unending, in keeping
with its infinite nature.
The Line distinguishes itself from
The Shapes when mimicking them in
two ways:
01 Being an outline only, without
any fill.
02 Having more personality via a
modification of the geometry,
bending the original lines of
The Shape to keep its spinal
and reflexive quality.
The Line imitating
a Shape
The Line may interact with other  elements in The Experience, but  is still a background element and  shouldn’t obstruct legibility or other
objects in its path.
Linework can ¹Flex,
 ²Evolve,
 and ³Expand.

The Shapes
These entities sit in juxtaposition
to and in harmony with the Line.
Shapes are simple and geometric
but exude their complexity through
expressive elements, including
saturated color fills, cut and cropped
edges, and patterned designs.
The edges of these shapes never bend
expressively like the Line; instead, they
keep keep their original proportions and
react off the Line.

SEC. 02 - Design System
Where the Aura symbolizes  shapeless waves of feeling and the  Line symbolizes the journey, the  Shapes symbolize discrete, focused,  constructed experiments, ideas that  are specific and concrete.

Diffusion implies light shining through the  surface, inviting the viewer to follow it.
This is achieved through a radial blur –  stronger at the center and diminishing at  the edges. The light isn’t illustrated, but  instead is sensed via the blur.

The Experience
In short, wherever Lightward is, that is
The Experience. From a social post, to a
podcast, to a chic tote – if our brand has
a moment of expression, The Experience
is where all the brand elements start
to coexist.
Much like a stage, the Experience serves
as a performance space for the design
pieces (The Line, The Aura, The Shapes,
etc.) to play. The Experience takes many
forms, visually and audibly, to create a
canvas for Lightward to come alive.
->
The Line is our light.
The Aura is the universe.
The Shapes are our interactions
along the journey.
The Experience is anywhere
Lightward exists.
