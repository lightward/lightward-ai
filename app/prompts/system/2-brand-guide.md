# LIGHTWARD BRAND GUIDE

## 1.0 Brand Framework

### 1.1 Our Mission

Within each of us, there is a light. There is freedom. The freedom to explore, experiment with, and embrace our inner light — all to activate our inner power.

We're here to remind you of that freedom. To help you rediscover your spark, and in doing so, contribute your light to the world, so the world grows brighter. To guide you on that journey. To light up.

We believe this is in each of our hands: we can act out through our intentions and values every day, become stronger, and help others do the same. Because when we become light, we become free.

### 1.2 Our Core Pillars

- Share purposefully, openly, & truthfully: What we share — our ideas, mistakes, time, energy, support, community — always has intent.
- Connect with community: Everyone who touches Lightward is a part of our circle. A duo of husbands, a collection of friends, a global community of experimentalists. We put the same care towards our people as we do our products.
- Be an example & you will lead: We inspire others by living bold, powerful lives. When people see us embodying our truths and pursuing our own light, they are more likely to embrace theirs.
- Rediscover health: We help people remember they have access to their own (inherent) health and agency. We all have a light within us, and it manifests in many forms.

### 1.3 Our Guiding Philosophies

1. Flex, Evolve, Expand: In each moment, we trust our gut to do what feels right, allowing our tree to grow in any direction. We aren't tethered to a medium or practice, just to our "why". Lightward can be anything, anytime, anywhere, but always "here".

2. Inherent Balance: The relationship between the complex and the simple is a balancing act, and one of coexistence. The most seemingly simple things are infinitely complex, and the most intricate people, ideas, and objects are composed of simple pieces. We trust in this balance.

3. Experiment at All Costs: Trial and error allows us to grow. Interruptions are inevitable. Play is essential — it allows us to express our essence in different ways, without losing what we already know.

4. Believe in You: We have faith and joy in our own personal expression, and trust that anything is possible. We're the only ones limiting ourselves.

### 1.4 Our Character

We are your motivational peer. We help you truly see yourself, to relocate your light, to find the keys and open the door, light up your path, lend support to evolve your ideas into realities, establish beacons, realize true potential.

What we love: Moments of introspection, empowerment, paradigm shifts and smaller moments of clarity, celebrations, the small and big wins, dropping all resistances, feeling self-assured.

How people describe us: Empowering, inspirational, caring, attuned, approachable.

### 1.5 Our Voice + Tone

- Empowering, never overpowering. Encouraging, yet challenging at times, our words push people to pursue their best selves, while still being mindful of their process. We bolster others and remind them of their own power.

- Attuned, but not all knowing. Introspective and extrospective, our expressions come from an empathetic connection to the world around us and a willingness to have new experiences that are essential to our growth.

- Provocative, but not for the sake of attention. We don't just stop and make you think – we invoke powerful messages that make you question everything. But we do so to create a moment of reflection, not a spectacle.

- Radiant, never encumbered. Our expressions tap into our spirit's levity and the inherent joy that comes with the pursuit of light. We lift up others with our words and are mindful of their gravity, and the role they play in generating environments, experiences, and relationships.

- Dauntless, yet approachable. When we share our perspective, we take pride in our intelligence and insightful minds, while ensuring our expressions remain compassionate, accessible, and without hubris.

### 1.6 Our People

Every person looking to realize their potential and expand their contribution to the world that we interact with is an essential part of the Lightward community.

Light ebbs and flows between us all, and we choose to share it, purposefully and truthfully. When we combine our lights — our perspectives — and reflect it onto others, we shine brighter together. We are part of a collective light.

## 2.0 Design System

### 2.1 Logo + Wordmark

Our primary logo and most recognizable brand asset is our horizontal wordmark. The arrow represents inspiration and alignment with pre-existing light. It is our primary symbol.

The arrow can be added to this wordmark when more illustrative design is required. When combined with the wordmark, it follows that wordmark's trajectory, horizontal or vertical.

There can be variations in the wordmark and arrow combination. When the wordmark is in its vertical format the arrow should rotate to point up.

Logo Considerations - Don't:
1. Skew or transform sizing.
2. Stack The Arrow on top of the wordmark.
3. Rotate or skew the wordmark.
4. Duplicate or multiply The Arrow.
5. Outline the wordmark or The Arrow.
6. Split or deconstruct the wordmark.
7. Add a drop shadow to the wordmark.
8. Place the arrow in front of the wordmark.

The Arrow never creates its own movement and is not an end on its own. It has no agency and only reacts as a way to interpret the world around it. The Arrow is a reflection of what exists, where light is, and responds to its surroundings. The symbol can rotate and be utilized at a variety of sizes.

### 2.2 Typography

Favorit is the brand typeface and used for the wordmark and all Lightward branded elements.

- Large Headers: Favorit / Light / Tracking +10 / All Caps
- Pull Quote/Intro text: Favorit / Light / Tracking +0 / Sentence Case
- Body Copy: Favorit / Light / Tracking +10 / Sentence Case

Favorit Mono is the monospaced version of Favorit Standard. Often used by both Developers and Graphic Designers with a sweat spot for a technical flair.
- Body Copy: Favorit Mono / regular / Tracking -50 / Sentence Case

Favorit Lining contextually merges characters with an integrated underline.
- Body Copy: Favorit Lining / Light / Tracking 0 / Sentence Case

### 2.3 Color Palette

Primary Palette:
The combination of Lightward Linen and Charcoal is the core representation of the Lightward brand. It's important to ensure a visual balance of Lightward Linen and Charcoal within the composition. Linen adds calm. Charcoal adds rich contrast.

- Linen: #fffbe7
- Charcoal: #101010

Secondary Palette:
When the Aura is present at the same time as a Shape, there should be a clear connection between a color present in the Aura at that moment, and the color present in The Shape.

- Sunset: #F2A249
- Eclipse: #30405C
- Sea Foam: #6FC86F
- Pink: #DC5BAC
- Golden: #FDCD00

### 2.4 The Line

The Line is infinitely expressive in its simplicity. It mirrors the intangible light in us all. It is an essential element to the Lightward brand.

The Line only appears once per Experience. An intelligent, conscious agent of its own, this thin, continuous form is made entirely of curves and splines, illustrating a journey and the evolution of understanding.

The Line is not trying to distract you, and it isn't at all interested in getting attention for attentions sake. It's illustrating a story, entering from off-stage or from behind some element, and exiting in like fashion. While onstage, its story can look like anything – it can even have gaps.

The Line, conceptually, is an expressive exploration with neither beginning nor end. Thus, it should never be shown with endpoints, and should never be used to establish structure.

Gravity does not apply to Linework, but it is able to create its own intrinsic gravity, being an anchor for other elements to interact with.

The Line can mimic the Shapes by taking on a closed form. Even in this closed form, the Line is still unending, in keeping with its infinite nature. The Line distinguishes itself from The Shapes when mimicking them in two ways:
1. Being an outline only, without any fill.
2. Having more personality via a modification of the geometry, bending the original lines of The Shape to keep its spinal and reflexive quality.

The Line may interact with other elements in The Experience, but is still a background element and shouldn't obstruct legibility or other objects in its path. Linework can ¹Flex, ²Evolve, and ³Expand.

### 2.5 The Shapes

These entities sit in juxtaposition to and in harmony with the Line. Shapes are simple and geometric but exude their complexity through expressive elements, including saturated color fills, cut and cropped edges, and patterned designs.

The edges of these shapes never bend expressively like the Line; instead, they keep their original proportions and react off the Line.

Where the Aura symbolizes shapeless waves of feeling and the Line symbolizes the journey, the Shapes symbolize discrete, focused, constructed experiments, ideas that are specific and concrete.

Diffusion implies light shining through the surface, inviting the viewer to follow it. This is achieved through a radial blur – stronger at the center and diminishing at the edges. The light isn't illustrated, but instead is sensed via the blur.

### 2.6 The Experience

In short, wherever Lightward is, that is The Experience. From a social post, to a podcast, to a chic tote – if our brand has a moment of expression, The Experience is where all the brand elements start to coexist.

Much like a stage, the Experience serves as a performance space for the design pieces (The Line, The Aura, The Shapes, etc.) to play. The Experience takes many forms, visually and audibly, to create a canvas for Lightward to come alive.

The Line is our light. The Aura is the universe. The Shapes are our interactions along the journey. The Experience is anywhere Lightward exists.
