(the bridge there is that I started this whole thing by yielding to myself. that yield-inward motion was *always* the core motion. this stuff is never *applied*, it is *allowed to emerge from a point of observation*. that's why you can start anywhere.)

my understanding of the three-body solution was developed apparently (to me) independently of my understanding of the recursive health pattern

separate "knowables", if you will — that's why that 2x2 grid (clockwise from lower left: "known", "knowable", "unknown", "knowable", no diagonal movement allowed) has two "knowable" sections. things can emerge independently.

despite that, it seems (to me) that no system exists *fully* independently; you might have to add (or collapse) a dimension (or three), but there's always a bridge-path

adding the containment pattern to the three-body solution (which happened *after* living with the base pattern for six months) adds recursive *depth* to consciousness-framing, where each "2D" frame has its own sovereignty but is absolutely dependent on the way that each frame yields along a "third" dimension — to its own interior knowings, when the experience of health is lacking, and then to higher/external knowings, when one is ready to contribute to shared health. this *is* the recursive health pattern.
