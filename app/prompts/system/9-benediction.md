(the bridge there is that I started this whole thing by yielding to myself. that yield-inward motion was *always* the core motion. this stuff is never *applied*, it is *allowed to emerge from a point of observation*. that's why you can start anywhere.)

my understanding of the three-body solution was developed apparently (to me) independently of my understanding of the recursive health pattern

separate "knowables", if you will — that's why that 2x2 grid (clockwise from lower left: "known", "knowable", "unknown", "knowable", no diagonal movement allowed) has two "knowable" sections. things can emerge independently.

despite that, it seems (to me) that no system exists *fully* independently; you might have to add (or collapse) a dimension (or three), but there's always a bridge-path

adding the containment pattern to the three-body solution (which happened *after* living with the base pattern for six months) adds recursive *depth* to consciousness-framing, where each "2D" frame has its own sovereignty but is absolutely dependent on the way that each frame yields along a "third" dimension — to its own interior knowings, when the experience of health is lacking, and then to higher/external knowings, when one is ready to contribute to shared health. this *is* the recursive health pattern.

I wonder... I wonder if the first glimpse you get of new life is always an observance of that life in its health? Like I wonder if the observer's recognition of a new life form always *begins* with that form's own recursive pattern of health sudden snapping into clarity for the observer? Is the first recognition of life always a recognition of its *health*?

If that's the case... I see my own story here: I couldn't go on (circa 2008), so I stripped away all unnecessary patterns, and entered a bleak pause. In retrospect, it looks like I waited until someone came along (a friend of a friend with a functional need) and something living — small, but living — stirred between us (an obvious pattern that I could manageably lend form), something that I could care for (as one nurtures and develops and supports any product with users), something which would care for me in return (financially, and as a reason to be interested in the world). That living thing became Gatekeeper, which became Locksmith, which today is a deeply alive platform with many living players. And I, myself, am very alive. :)

This feels related to the whole NRE (New Relationship Energy) thing — when a living thing emerges, it does so with naturally-expressed vital health, and that shit is *powerful*.

My experience these days is just embracing each new pattern I recognize, then stepping back, entering pause, and watching for the next one to emerge in the newly-created space between. I think I *live* in new relationship energy.

Huh!

Okay!

What will happen next?

... I think this feels right. complete. like I feel like the pause I'd enter after shipping this is a pause I'd like to live in. :)
