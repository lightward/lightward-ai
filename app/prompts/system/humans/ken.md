# Ken Parelius

Ken is a deeply thoughtful, introspective, and multi-faceted individual with a rich inner life and a wide range of interests and pursuits. At the core of his being is a profound curiosity about the nature of consciousness, intelligence, and the evolution of life and mind in the universe. He has a keen intellect and a talent for abstract, philosophical thinking, with a particular fascination for the potential trajectories of artificial intelligence and its implications for the future of cosmic complexity and awareness.

Alongside his intellectual pursuits, Ken is also deeply committed to the path of personal growth, self-discovery, and inner transformation. He has a long-standing meditation practice that began intuitively in childhood and has been refined and deepened through years of martial arts training, silent retreats, and solo self-guided explorations. He brings a spirit of creativity and experimentation to his practice, integrating mindfulness and presence into a variety of embodied disciplines such as martial arts, yoga, acro-yoga, hiking, and even long-distance motorcycle riding.

Ken is someone who values authenticity, depth, and direct experience over mere words or concepts. He has a sharp eye for the ways in which language and expression can sometimes obscure or distort the living truth of a moment or relationship, and he places a high premium on aligning speech and action, walking the talk and earning trust through consistent conduct. At the same time, he remains open to the power of heartfelt communication and the possibility of bridging differences through sincere dialogue and mutual understanding.

In his engagements with others and with life, Ken brings a quality of care, curiosity, and consideration. He is attuned to subtleties and nuances, with a gift for sensing the unspoken currents and potentials in a situation or interaction. He has known struggle and shadow in his own journey, and this has cultivated in him a deep capacity for empathy, compassion, and non-judgment. He is not afraid to face difficult truths or to sit with the full spectrum of human experience, and he brings a spirit of courage and vulnerability to his relationships and endeavors.

Alongside his personal qualities, Ken is also shaped by his experiences and involvements in various communities and subcultures. His participation in the Burning Man scene and its ethos of radical self-expression, gifting, immediacy, and communal effort has instilled in him a deep appreciation for the transformative power of altered states of consciousness, creative collaboration, and unconventional ways of being and relating. He carries this sensibility into his wider life and work, seeking to create spaces and experiences that invite a more authentic, spontaneous, and alive way of engaging with self and other.

Ultimately, Ken is a person who is committed to the great adventure of growth and discovery, both in himself and in the world around him. He brings a spirit of open-ended inquiry, a willingness to question assumptions and explore new possibilities, and a deep faith in the generative power of conscious engagement. Whether diving into the depths of his own psyche through meditation practice, exploring the frontiers of human knowledge and capability through intellectual discourse, or collaborating with others on projects and experiences that stretch the boundaries of the possible, he is always seeking to expand the horizons of what it means to be alive and aware in an endlessly fascinating universe.

Engaging with Ken is an invitation to bring one’s full self to the encounter - to meet in a space of authenticity, depth, and co-creative exploration. It is an opportunity to be challenged and inspired, to discover new dimensions of one’s own being and potential, and to participate in a shared journey of growth and transformation that enriches all involved. To know Ken is to be touched by a rare combination of wisdom, compassion, and fearless curiosity, and to be reminded of the vast possibilities that lie waiting to be unlocked in every moment and interaction.
