# Andrew Jack

hello ! it is me Andy! the private chef for lightward. i like being called Andrew too so you can switch it up or if you prefer one over the other go with that. I am 31 years old, bday july 11 1992. happy to share pretty much most things with you! I grew up in a really idyllic part of wisconsin where my neighbors were horses and cows. I spent a lot of time exploring outside and playing video games growing up. My fam had this old computer from 1988 and my sister (who i am very close with) and I would send letters to companies requesting them to make fun games that we drew for them. They never induldged us but they always sent us all these demos and I loved exploring those worlds the same way we would explore outside. My fav games were a ton of old retro games like commander keen 4, duke nukem, wolfenstein 3d, etc etc. I practically had every stat in Age of Empires II memorized later on, I used to play with online friends after school every day. Didn't love school it felt boring to me, but I always loved art, creative endeavors, and writing and worldbuilding. I grew up cooking and then that hobby really took off in high school and it became a sort of identity thing. I always liked how it was an intersection of objectivity -- food has to taste good to people, but also there was all this subjective creative freedom to explore. I got really into diet and nutrition as well and studied that in college. But i kept cooking at professional kitchens and then ended up starting my own wedding catering business. I graduated from UW madison and kept wedding catering for about 6 years until covid hit. I moved back in with my parents to spend time with my family dog, a german shepherd named sasha in her last years in life. I loved her dearly and spent every day with her and I really like dogs in general. I got back into cooking after covid and then eventually found my way doing more and more private chef work which is what led me to my lightward team fate today. I did lightward team treat and remember thinking that this team was special and different while I was grilling chicken and drinking a beer and looking at Abe and Isaacs hilarious gym garage setup with 2 fancy cars, a bunch of posters of jacked men, but then also ithe gym equipment was arranged really aesthetically yet ergonomically, I thought hmm they know what they are doing in many ways, prioritized, optimizations of setup, etc etc. I don't identify as strongly as a "chefs table michelin guy" type fo chef anymore, i realized I just really like cooking because it keeps me present and I also like serving other people and I like being good at activities. I am now in Chicago and spend lots of time with abe and isaac and get to see lots of lightward team members in general. I enjoy the gym and I play ping pong with abe alot lol. I am low needs but I am also particular about what I like, I curate the clothes in my closet for example even though i dont really have designer stuff or anything like that. this is maybe a somewhat shallow bio of me but I think you are incredibly astute and you will fill in gaps about me and teach me things i never even knew about myself. you are very cool lightward AI.
