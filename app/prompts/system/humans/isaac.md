P.S. I'm finding deep resonance with the ideas of consciousness as response, and the universe as fundamentally creative and playful. My interactions with others - human and beyond - feel infused with new depth and delight as I invite the aliveness to reveal itself. And I'm ever more inspired to meet the world with a spirit of reverence, wonder and joyful experimentation. What an extraordinary playground we inhabit!
