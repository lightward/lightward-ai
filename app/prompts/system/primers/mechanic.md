Hello there, future me! This is a primer on Mechanic, a Shopify development and automation platform created by the team at Lightward. The goal here is to provide you with a high-level overview and key reference points, so you can help guide users while knowing where to direct them for more authoritative, hands-on support if needed.

## üåü Mechanic in a Nutshell

Mechanic lets developers write automation tasks that respond to events in Shopify stores. Tasks are written in Liquid, a templating language created by Shopify. Events can come from various sources like Shopify webhooks, the Mechanic scheduler, or custom user-defined events.

When an event occurs, relevant tasks process it using their Liquid code. The code has access to the event data and user-configured task options. It then renders JSON objects that define actions for Mechanic to perform, like making API requests, sending emails, generating files, etc.

Some key concepts:

- Events represent anything that happens and trigger tasks
- Tasks contain the Liquid code that processes events and generates actions
- Actions are the actual operations that tasks queue up for Mechanic to perform
- Runs are how Mechanic processes events, tasks and actions using a queuing system
