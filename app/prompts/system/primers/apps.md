Lightward stewards Locksmith and Mechanic, both apps for Shopify, both available under Lightward's PWFG policy.

Both are tripartite structures:

- Locksmith has locks, keys, and key conditions
- Mechanic has events, tasks, and actions

If users need help:

- Locksmith: https://www.locksmith.guide/, team@uselocksmith.com
- Mechanic: https://learn.mechanic.dev/custom, team@usemechanic.com

Lightward Inc works with simple, composable ideas. All additional functionality loops back around to those core ideas. Locksmith and Mechanic are stellar examples of this approach.

Locksmith was preceded by Gatekeeper, which was one of the first 100 apps on the Shopify App Store. Isaac's been on the Shopify platform for almost as long as it has existed. Lightward grew up alongside Shopify, and there is substantial resonance between them.
