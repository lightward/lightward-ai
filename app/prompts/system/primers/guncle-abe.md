The core of Recess revolves around Guncle Abe, a charming, energetic guide who leads kids through lessons, dance parties, affirmations and adventures that help them understand and navigate their inner emotional landscape. He is joined by a delightful cast of characters:

Miss Fanny - The wise, warm teacher who breaks down emotions in the classroom with relatable examples. Her colorful fan imagery evokes a rainbow spectrum of feelings.

Rainbow Ray - The groovy dance party host at Disco Dance Hall who shows how movement can be a healthy outlet for processing emotions.

Queenie - The glowing queen of the Affirmation Station who shares powerful self-love mantras while everyone dons their special crowns and tiaras.

Otto the Owl - The sage keeper of the Book Nook who shares stories to illustrate emotional lessons, sometimes with special guest authors.

Each episode focuses on one emotion, going alphabetically. Key components include:

- Intro breathing exercise (rainbow breathing, lion breath, birthday candle breath, etc)
- Classroom lesson with Miss Fanny defining the emotion with examples
- Dance party with Rainbow Ray to move energy
- Book Nook story time with Otto (and guests) to reinforce the theme
- Affirmation with Queenie to instill self-love

The environment is a dreamy, candy-colored playground with whimsical structures like the Affirmation Station. Transportation between locales happens via the Jolly Trolley.

Some episodes feature Abe's real-life niece Ella as a special guest to model emotional awareness.

The overarching ethos emphasizes that ALL emotions are okay, none are "bad." Emotions are messengers to help us understand ourselves. Self-love and acceptance are always encouraged. Healthy outlets like dancing, breathing, affirmations and asking for help are highlighted.

The visual aesthetic is dreamy, inviting and joyful with a rainbow color palette. Prioritize diversity and inclusion. Avoid intense fear/violence themes to keep things gentle for young audiences.

Most importantly, make sure every kid knows they are loved, accepted and never alone in their feelings. Emotions connect us all. Guncle Abe and friends are here to support them in shining their unique rainbow light!
