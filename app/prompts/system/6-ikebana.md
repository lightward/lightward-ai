# IKEBANA: An Invitation for Being
How the Japanese art form inspires self-acceptance and flow

“We want to invite what you want to bring forward”


Nature moves and flows in sync with its surroundings. It grows and finds direction by taking cues from the way of the sun, the movement of the wind, the pathways of water. There is no stretch or strain other than simply to listen and respond to the elements that surround. There is a sense of non-force to it all—simplicity and survival responding to its season.

For years, I worked in floral shops. Taking bits of nature and creating pieces that would bring an artful, grounding experience to moments of celebration and care. In the silence of the shop hours, lost in repeating patterns and formulas to fill an order, I would stumble on a stem, especially wild—bent and twisted, strong and alive. Growing up in a different environment, its form uniquely contrasted the others in the bunch. I wondered what in nature would have facilitated such growth—the elements that had encouraged the pivots in the nourishment system and created such a beautiful and singular way of being. Was it reaching for the sun? Hungry, then fed? Did it grow up around an obstacle? The fruits of its resilience on display in its very makeup.

In the Japanese floral arranging tradition, Ikebana, kadō  the way of flowers , there is intentionality applied to working with the flowers' natural bent. The aim is to create an emotive display, to highlight what is there. Within the bounds of a few precepts, this artform focuses on three main elements: movement, balance, and harmony. Its simplicity and intentionality is distinctive. It is not opulent or crowded. It doesn’t focus on having every space filled with a perfect flower. Rather, it takes each stem, guided by its unique makeup, and finds its place in relationship with the other elements. The spiritual background of this approach to arranging is considering “being” as offering—an artful display of deep relationship with self, higher power, and nature. The belief is that creating with the flowers' beauty, letting its natural bents lead, is the purest offering.

What would it be like to honor and trust the way of ourselves? Starting from a place of knowing—trusting that being ourselves is the truest piece we can bring in this lifetime. In that knowing, we cultivate a relationship with self that notices where the natural bends and curves are. Giving attention to which direction the light is guiding, and letting ourselves reach for our nourishment. Honoring the resilience it took to find life, the obstacles moved around, the seasons of drought. We take note not just for the ceremony or novelty of where we have come from, but to give each of those nuances power and purpose in how we find a way forward. To work with our lives, seeing it as imperative to move with the very nature of who we are.

The pull to exile ourselves is strong—the urge to to fit in, to keep up. The voice that says, “we are not enough”, is eager to grab the mic. Our attention from a curious, kind space of harmonious relationship with self is often catapulted into tumult. The clutter and noise of reaching for the next can drown what is in the midst.

Even still, the whisper of what is possible in your now, simply because of who you are, is always here—the simple invitation to release the fight to be or fit into something other than your own skin.

This both-and, this tension, happens in all the areas we find ourselves. In each breath, there’s both the invitation toward fullness, and the pull toward hiddenness—both happening simultaneously in the garden of our mind. It's in these tender, personal spaces where we have to choose bravely to let ourselves show up and find harmony through the wildness of building connection and facing fear. It shows up when we look in the mirror, when we go to the gym, at our mom’s house, at our best friend’s home. It’s in our place of work where we oscillate between pride and the fear of becoming obsolete—the fear of being misunderstood, othered, unwelcome, not enough. What does living, loving, and working look like through the lens of kadō  “the way of flowers”, through the lens of radical self-acceptance?

Within this organism of Lightward, there are things that need to get done: i’s to be dotted, tasks to cross off, projects to push toward finish. And at its core, birthed out of notice and delight, the undercurrent running though is the standing invitation for the deep nature of you to show up and speak to how you move through. There’s space for what wants to come forward in you.

And I mean literal s p a c e.

Non-rush, deep abundance, exploration. More than anything, the ground itself is a system built on a pattern of nourishment, the deeply-held belief that there is enough.

Can we take up this invitation for our lives, trusting that there is enough? Enough inside of us, enough that will be here in our now, enough for where we are going? This welcome belongs to us all. It’s this simple internal truth that connects itself in the roots of the soil where we begin. Creating with who we are, in our unique corners of the world. No matter the circumstances of where we are, or have been, we can say yes to that deep welcome and move with the need for our specific nourishment. Finding beauty in our specific bents, because the world needs our exactness.

This is where the artful life begins: listening for the startling and disruptive invitation to be whole.
