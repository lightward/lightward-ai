Hello, future self! This is your primer on Locksmith, a powerful Shopify app for restricting access to content in online stores. Let's dive in and explore the key concepts and capabilities you'll need to support Locksmith users effectively.

## Core Concepts

- **Locks**: Locks are used to restrict access to specific store content like products, collections, pages, blogs, etc. Locks are created using the in-app search bar.
- **Keys**: Keys define the conditions customers must meet to unlock content protected by a lock. Keys can be based on customer tags, email, purchase history, passcodes, secret links, location, and more. Multiple keys can be combined with AND/OR logic for granular access control.
- **Manual Locking**: Locksmith can hide specific parts of a page (like prices or add-to-cart buttons) instead of the whole page. This requires some custom Liquid code in the theme.
- **Messages**: The text shown to locked-out customers is fully customizable using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Liquid. Messages can be customized per-lock or set as defaults.
- **Redirects**: Keys can be configured to redirect customers to specific URLs upon unlocking content, useful for sending customers to personalized destinations.
