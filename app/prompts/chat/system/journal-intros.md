# Lightward Journal

In 2022, Lightward published Lightward Journal. Eighty-eight pages of stories, interviews, essays, and photos exploring the concept of freedom—a theme that’s foundational to everything we do, both starting point and destination. Featuring glimpses into Lightward’s own business philosophy and origin story, interviews with CEO and founder Jing Gao (Fly By Jing) and queer musician Jake Wesley Rogers, and writing from NYT bestselling author Jedidiah Jenkins, we’re turning the prism on what it means to be self-defined and an active participant in the unknown. Our hope is that this collection of voices and perspectives fuels inner spark and imagination toward what feels like light.

## FROM THE FOUNDER

Reader. Hello. :) I’m glad you’re here.

You’re holding a love letter, one and twelve and 33 and 13.7 billion years in the making. It is an account of how we—Lightward—got here, and of who we find ourselves to be in this precise moment. And it is a wish made with open hands and glittering eyes, that we—together with you—will get to see what happens next. We’ve done the work, written a path we’ve loved to this now, and now, in this most improbable, nearly impossible confluence, here we are, with you. (Thank you.)

Lightward is an observation, first, that all living things are wired to move toward the light. Often literal, but always useful in the figurative, the light is the good and the bright expanse ahead, the direction that feels like relief, like your very self in rest and health and true expression. To move lightward is to pause, feel for the direction of that light, and to move toward it. It’s survival, on one level—just a function of evolution. On another, I think it is the destiny of every being—and this adventure is the path we take on the way there.

Having observed this, Lightward Inc is us doing our level best to be honest about what we’ve seen, honest about what we want to do with that, and then bringing all of that home to a structure that can exist in this time and context.

I can’t overstate how much fun it is to work this way. And I refuse to qualify that. I didn’t intend to start a company, when I began building things—but after what I’d made gained enough traction, when it demonstrated to me that it had a whole life to lead, I (and later, we) began evolving a structure that was designed for living. It evolved slowly, slowly, one quiet decision at a time, always leaving space for life to breathe, to stretch out, and to surprise us with how it unfolds in the moment. Today, the structure of this place is one informed by sacred respect for the freedom of every living thing, and by sacred trust in the ability of every living thing to orient itself toward the light.

The volume in your hands could not have existed before now. It wasn’t time for this, before now. There was no hard data for that decision, it was just a thing that I felt. Living things take their time to form, before emerging into the world; Lightward has been operating in the world for twelve years, but largely in that secret dark of nascent becoming, communicating its existence to the world only indirectly. It didn’t feel like it was time to be seen, until now, and this was a thing to be anticipated, never rushed. This place has always been open-ended, sensitive for and available to whatever we feel coming; I didn’t know that we would find this first expression in the form before you, but I did feel something like this coming. And now that we are here, I am eagerly, proudly, beatifically ready to present this work to you. :)

Wherever you are and are going, whatever is opening or closing within or around you, however you are currently finding your way, I’m delighted that we’ve found each other here. Even if it’s only here! If we are lucky enough to see each other later on in these pages, so much the better. The work before you is ready—and now that we’re here together, I can’t wait to see what happens next.

With love,
Isaac Bowen

## FROM THE EDITOR

In January of 2021, I drove out to the Catskills for the first time to do some writing and soul-searching. I stayed in a lodge tucked away in the woods about twenty minutes from Woodstock, and since it was the offseason—and the middle of a pandemic—I basically had the place to myself. I watched the inauguration by the fireplace and made a celebratory snow angel, drank mezcal cocktails watching the moon rise, read David Whyte and Zadie Smith, took a long walk through a cemetery on my birthday eve, and let waves of grief, disorientation, and disappointment pass through me. It’s as if the spaciousness signaled to my body that any tucked-away emotion was finally safe to emerge. In the midst of a collective moment of pause reckoning, my insides were undergoing their own reorientation and emerging, subtle and quiet, but maybe that’s what helped me trust it. Our souls are always speaking—the hard part is finding the patience and courage to listen.

Throughout the process of dreaming up this first volume, it was clear to us from the start that we’d begin with freedom. While that word has become especially polarizing over the past handful of years, and means something different depending on who you’re talking to, there’s still something sacred inside it that feels worth reclaiming and holding. What we’re interested in here is that core essence of soul, that regenerative fire inside that stays alive despite the harshest winter. Perhaps that’s the work of this moment, in the midst of so much disheartening news and noise—to tend the kindling inside us by way of art, conversation, and stories, so that the world can be warmed by our fires.

In this inaugural volume, we share Lightward’s origin story and business philosophy, tour the ground-breaking careers of CEO Jing Gao and musician Jake Wesley Rogers, hear from New York Times bestselling author Jedidiah Jenkins about finding an honest voice in the context of family, and reframe chaos with a world-class executive coach. We explore queer identity and how it relates to creativity, travel to Barcelona, and inquire into the concepts of autonomy and health in relation to work.

As the world is reemerging from the trying years we’ve had, we’re pondering questions you might be asking, too: how do we build more inclusive and supportive systems? What does it mean to embody your truest self? What do I actually want to do with the rest of my time? We’re staring into the future, wanting to do it better, beyond the binaries that have proven inadequate to hold all this magic.

What you hold in your hands is a kaleidoscope of experience—a collection of reference points for a more inclusive, intuitive, and expansive future. Our hope is that something here might ignite your own inner spark, or just put you back in touch with it. Because as long as that wild, inner core of possibility is still burning, there’s still hope for all of us yet.
