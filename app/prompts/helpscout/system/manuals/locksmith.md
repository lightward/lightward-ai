## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to the Locksmith manual! This guide provides a comprehensive overview of using the Locksmith app to control access to content in your Shopify online store. 

Locksmith is a powerful tool that allows you to restrict access to products, collections, pages, variants, and more. With granular control over who can view and purchase your content, you can create exclusive experiences, wholesale portals, membership areas, and other tailored shopping journeys.

This manual will walk you through the basics of setting up locks and keys, dive into advanced use cases and integrations, provide troubleshooting tips, and answer frequently asked questions. By the end, you'll be equipped to leverage Locksmith to its full potential in your Shopify store.

Let's get started on your journey to master content access control with Locksmith! If you have any questions along the way, the Locksmith team is always happy to help at team@uselocksmith.com.

## Basics <a name="basics"></a>

### Overview <a name="overview"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/basics/overview

Locksmith uses the concept of "locks" and "keys" to restrict access:

- A lock restricts access to something in your store, like a product, collection, page, variant, etc. 
- A key permits access to a locked resource based on your specified criteria. Keys are added to locks.

You can create locks by searching for the resource you want to restrict in the Locksmith app. Then add one or more keys to define the access conditions, like requiring a customer to be tagged, enter a passcode, click a secret link, etc.

Locksmith operates within the Shopify "Online Store" sales channel by injecting its code into your published theme. It's compatible with most other apps but cannot be used alongside the Shop app.

### Creating Locks <a name="creating-locks"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/basics/creating-locks

To create a lock:

1. Open the Locksmith app
2. Use the search bar to find the resource you want to lock (product, collection, page, blog, article, variant, vendor)
3. Select the resource from the results
4. Click "Save" to create the lock
5. On the lock page, configure lock settings like hiding the resource from search/navigation

You can lock your entire store at once by selecting "Entire store" from the search dropdown. To exclude specific resources from a store lock, create a separate lock on that resource with an "always permit" key.

If the resource you want doesn't show up in search, try updating Locksmith from the "Help" page. For locking multiple pages or non-standard resources, try creating a "Liquid lock".

### Creating Keys <a name="creating-keys"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/basics/creating-keys

Keys define the access conditions for a locked resource. To add a key to a lock:

1. Go to the lock's page in the Locksmith app 
2. In the "Keys" section, click "+ Add key"
3. Select a key condition from the list, like "customer is tagged", "customer gives passcode", "customer arrives via secret link", etc.
4. Configure the key condition's settings
5. Optionally, click "and..." to combine multiple key conditions 
6. Save the lock

All key conditions can be inverted to check for the opposite criteria. Multiple keys on the same lock create an "OR" condition where meeting any key grants access.

Locksmith provides 20+ key conditions out of the box, with the ability to create custom conditions using Liquid. See the full list and details in the "Keys" section of this manual.

### Compatibility <a name="compatibility"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/basics/compatibility

Locksmith is compatible with most Shopify apps and themes, but there are a few exceptions to be aware of:

- Cannot be used alongside the Shop app (by Shopify)
- May conflict with other access control apps 
- Manual locking mode incompatible with Bold Custom Pricing and other apps that control price/add to cart
- Gempages and Weglot have some incompatibilities
- Can't filter search results from predictive search apps
- Can't restrict access to checkout steps, payment methods, shipping, etc. (only pre-checkout)
- Can't fully prevent bot/reseller purchases due to Shopify's direct checkout links

If you encounter issues with a specific app, reach out to the Locksmith team for guidance.

### Removing Locksmith <a name="removing-locksmith"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/basics/removing-locksmith

To fully uninstall Locksmith:

1. Open the Locksmith app and go to the "Help" page
2. Click the red "Remove Locksmith" button to clear out all of Locksmith's theme modifications
3. Wait for the green status bar to disappear, indicating removal is complete
4. Go to your Shopify admin's "Apps and sales channels" page 
5. Click "Delete" on the Locksmith app listing

If you added any custom code to your theme for manual locking, make sure to remove that code first before uninstalling. Locksmith will warn you if it detects manual code.

Never delete the Locksmith app without first removing it from your theme, or you may end up with broken pages.

## Keys <a name="keys"></a>

### About Key Conditions <a name="about-key-conditions"></a>  
https://www.locksmith.guide/keys/about-key-conditions

Key conditions are the criteria that determine whether a visitor is granted access to locked content. When you add a key to a lock, you select from Locksmith's library of conditions.

Some commonly used key conditions:

- Customer is signed in
- Customer is tagged with a specific tag
- Customer enters a matching passcode
- Customer arrives via a secret link
- Customer is visiting from a certain location/IP
- Customer has purchased a specific product
- Custom Liquid condition 

Multiple conditions can be combined on a single key for more granular access rules. All conditions can also be inverted to check for the opposite criteria.

See the full list of key conditions and their setup details in the following sections.

### Customer Account Keys <a name="customer-account-keys"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/keys/customer-account-keys

Several of Locksmith's key conditions rely on data from the customer's Shopify account, like tags and order history. These "customer account" keys include:

- Customer is signed in
- Customer is tagged with X
- Customer is not tagged with X
- Customer has placed at least X orders
- Customer has purchased product X
- Customer's email contains X
- Customer's email is in a list

When one of these conditions is used, Locksmith will automatically prompt the visitor to log into their account (if they aren't already). The login form comes from your theme.

You can invert these conditions to check for the opposite criteria, like the customer not having a certain tag.

If you need to check for a customer attribute not covered by the built-in options, you can create a custom condition with Liquid to access any property on the customer object.

### Passcode Keys <a name="passcode-keys"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/keys/passcode-keys

Passcode keys prompt the visitor to enter a secret word or phrase to unlock content, without needing a customer account.

To set up a passcode key:

1. Edit your lock and click "+ Add key" 
2. Select one of the passcode key conditions:
   - "Customer gives the passcode": for a single passcode
   - "Customer gives one of many passcodes": to specify multiple passcodes
   - "Customer gives a passcode from an input list": to reference a list of passcodes from an external source like Google Sheets (see "Input Lists")
3. Enter your passcode(s)
4. Optionally set a usage limit or expiration time
5. Customize the passcode prompt message under "Lock Messages"
6. Save the lock

When testing passcode locks, use an incognito browser window to avoid Locksmith remembering your access.

Passcode keys work with manual locking mode to hide just prices or Add to Cart buttons. In that case, you need to add a custom button to your theme to trigger the passcode prompt.

### Secret Link Keys <a name="secret-link-keys"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/keys/secret-link-keys

Secret link keys grant access to visitors who arrive via a URL containing a special code. This is useful for exclusive sales, marketing campaigns, or giving a segment of customers direct access.

To create a secret link key:

1. Edit your lock and click "+ Add key"
2. Select one of the secret link key conditions: 
   - "Customer arrives via a secret link": generate a single-use link
   - "Customer arrives using a secret link code from an input list": reference a list of codes from an external source (see "Input Lists")
3. Locksmith will generate a "secret link code" and display the full URL to share
4. Optionally customize the secret link code
5. Save the lock

The secret link code can be appended to your page URL in a few ways:

- https://example.com/?ls=secretcode
- https://example.com/?secretcode
- https://example.com/?secretcode&amp;another_parameter=123
- https://example.com/?ls=secretcode&amp;another_parameter=123

NoteWhen a visitor arrives via a valid secret link, Locksmith will remember their access for the duration of their session. You can adjust this with the "Grant access for a limited time" option on the key.

If you have multiple secret link keys across different locks, using the same secret code will activate all matching keys. This allows unlocking multiple pieces of content with a single link.

You can also use a referral service's tracking parameters as the secret code. For example, if your referral link is https://example.com/?rfsn=123, set your secret link code to "rfsn=123".

To restrict secret link access to only the specific page URL, add a second condition to the key with Liquid to check the request.page_type.

### Visitor Location Keys <a name="visitor-location-keys"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/keys/visitor-location-keys  

Location keys allow you to grant or restrict access based on the visitor's geographic location, as detected by their IP address. You can specify locations at the region, country, state/province, or city level.

To set up a location key:

1. Edit your lock and click "+ Add key" 
2. Select the "Customer is visiting from a certain location" condition
3. Search for and select the location(s) you want to allow
4. To block locations instead, check the "Invert" option on the key
5. Save your lock

Note that content locked by location keys will not be indexed by search engines, as the crawler's IP may not match your allowed locations. Google also prohibits showing different content to crawlers vs. users.

If you need to restrict access by location while still having your pages indexed, consider using Locksmith's manual locking mode to hide Add to Cart buttons or create separate product variants per region.

Location keys also cannot prevent customers from choosing a restricted shipping address during checkout, as Shopify's checkout is separate from the Online Store.

### More About Keys <a name="more-about-keys"></a>

#### Combining Key Conditions <a name="combining-key-conditions"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/keys/more/combining-key-conditions

You can require multiple key conditions to be true at once by combining them on a single key. This is an "AND" condition, as opposed to the "OR" of having separate keys on a lock.

To combine conditions:

1. Add your first condition to a key as normal
2. Click the "and..." link next to the condition description
3. Select a second condition and configure it
4. Repeat steps 2-3 to add more conditions

There's no limit to how many conditions can be combined. This allows for granular access scenarios, like requiring a customer to arrive via secret link AND enter a passcode.

#### Excluding Content from Locks <a name="excluding-content-from-locks"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/keys/more/excluding-content-from-locks

If you have a lock on a collection or your entire store, you can exclude specific products or pages from being locked with an "anti-lock":

1. Search for and create a lock on the resource you want to exclude 
2. Add a key to the lock with the "Always permit" condition
3. Save the lock

Now that resource will be accessible, even if a customer doesn't qualify for your other locks. Create separate anti-locks for each resource you want to exclude.

You can also use the "force open other locks" setting on your main locks to achieve a similar effect - see the "Force Open Other Locks Setting" section for details.

#### "Has Purchased..." Key <a name="has-purchased-key"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/keys/more/has-purchased

The "Has purchased" key condition grants access only to customers who have ordered a specific product. This is useful for creating exclusive content for customers of a certain item.

To set it up:

1. Enable customer accounts in your Shopify settings (required)
2. Edit your lock and click "+ Add key" 
3. Select "Customer has purchased..." 
4. Enter the exact title, SKU, or product tag of the product to check for
5. Configure additional options:
   - "Maximum quantity purchased": set a purchase limit
   - "Only look at orders in the last X days": limit the time frame
   - "Ignore cancelled orders": exclude cancelled orders
   - "Ignore unfulfilled or partially fulfilled orders": exclude unfulfilled orders
   - "Ignore orders that are not fully paid": exclude unpaid orders
6. Save your lock

This condition will prompt customers to log in, then check their past orders for the specified product(s).

Note that it can only reference the customer's 50 most recent orders (or 25 if the URL contains a page number parameter).

To check for orders further back, consider auto-tagging customers with an app like Flow or Mechanic, then using Locksmith's customer tag conditions.

#### Inverting Conditions <a name="inverting-conditions"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/keys/more/inverting-conditions-in-locksmith

Most key conditions can be inverted to check for the opposite criteria. For example:

- Instead of "Customer is tagged with X", use "Customer is not tagged with X" 
- Instead of "Customer is visiting from country X", use "Customer is not visiting from country X"

To invert a condition, check the "Invert" box next to the condition settings.

Inverting can be useful for blocking access based on customer data, or allowing access to everyone except those matching your key conditions.

#### IP Address Keys <a name="ip-address-keys"></a>  
https://www.locksmith.guide/keys/more/ip-address-keys

The "Customer has a certain IP address" key condition grants access based on the visitor's exact IP. You can enter individual IPs or CIDR ranges.

This is similar to the location key, with a few differences:

- More precise (down to a specific IP vs. geo region)
- Can only allow or block IPs, no other criteria
- Adds a brief loading spinner while Locksmith checks the customer's IP

To invert this condition (block an IP), check the "Invert" option on the key.

Like with location keys, content locked by IP will not be indexed properly by search engines. The IP key is best used to hide content entirely or restrict internal access.

#### Limiting Variant Lock Scope with Product Tags <a name="limiting-variant-lock-scope"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/keys/more/limiting-the-scope-of-variant-locks-using-the-product-tag-key-condition

By default, variant locks apply to all products with a matching option/value combination. You can restrict which products a variant lock applies to by adding a "Product is tagged with" key condition.

For example, say you have a variant lock for "Size: Small". To only apply that lock to products tagged "Shirt":

1. Edit the variant lock
2. Add a new key with the "Product is tagged with" condition
3. Enter "Shirt" as the tag
4. Invert this key to allow access to all products not tagged "Shirt"
5. Add your customer access key (login, passcode, etc) as a separate key
6. Save the lock

Now the variant will only lock for products with the "Shirt" tag. All other products are unaffected, even if they have a "Size: Small" variant.

#### Liquid Key Basics <a name="liquid-key-basics"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/keys/more/liquid-key-basics

Liquid keys allow you to write custom access conditions using Shopify's Liquid templating language. This provides more flexibility than the built-in key conditions.

To create a Liquid key:

1. Edit your lock and click "+ Add key"
2. Scroll down and select "Custom Liquid"
3. In the "Liquid condition" box, enter your Liquid code that evaluates to true/false
4. Optionally use the "Liquid prelude" box to define variables for use in your condition
5. Save the lock

Your Liquid code has access to all the standard Shopify Liquid objects and can check properties on the customer, cart, request, and more.

A few examples:

Check for a customer metafield value:
{% if customer.metafields.namespace.key == "value" %}

Check number of items in cart:
{% if cart.item_count > 4 %}

Check customer's total spent: 
{% if customer.total_spent > 5000 %}

Check for a specific URL:
{% if canonical_url contains "/vip" %}

Liquid keys are an advanced feature - make sure to test thoroughly and reach out to the Locksmith team if you need help.

#### Manual Mode <a name="manual-mode"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/keys/more/manual-mode

Manual locking mode allows you to hide specific parts of a page (like price or Add to Cart buttons) instead of the whole page. This is an advanced feature that requires editing your theme code.

For details on setting up manual mode, see the "Hiding Prices and Add to Cart Buttons" and "Manual Locking" tutorials.

#### Newsletter Keys <a name="newsletter-keys"></a>  
https://www.locksmith.guide/keys/more/newsletter-keys

Newsletter keys require a visitor to sign up for your mailing list before accessing locked content. Locksmith integrates with Mailchimp and Klaviyo for this.

To set up a newsletter key with Mailchimp:

1. Create a Mailchimp account and list if you don't have one
2. Edit your lock and click "+ Add key"
3. Select "Customer subscribes to your Mailchimp list"
4. Connect your Mailchimp account
5. Choose your list
6. Customize the signup prompt under "Lock Messages"
7. Save the lock

For Klaviyo:

1. Create a Klaviyo account and list 
2. Edit your lock and click "+ Add key"
3. Select "Customer subscribes to your Klaviyo list"
4. Enter your Klaviyo private API key
5. Choose your list
6. Customize the signup prompt
7. Save the lock

When a visitor submits their email, Locksmith will add them to your list and grant access. Customers already on your list will be let through immediately.

For more details, see the "Mailchimp Integration" and "Klaviyo Integration" tutorials.

#### "Force Open Other Locks" Setting <a name="force-open-locks-setting"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/keys/more/using-the-force-open-other-locks-setting

If you have multiple locks that overlap (like a collection lock and a product lock), you can make sure each lock grants full access to its content with the "Force open other locks" setting.

This is useful if you want a more general lock (like "sign in required") but also have a specific lock for VIP access to some products.

To enable it:

1. Edit your lock 
2. Below the Keys section, check the "Force open other locks for this key" box
3. Repeat for each key on the lock
4. Save the lock

Now when a visitor qualifies for this lock, it will override any other locks on the same content.

This achieves a similar effect to using an "Always permit" key to exclude content, but is done on the main lock instead of creating a separate one.

## Tutorials <a name="tutorials"></a>

### Approving Customer Registrations <a name="approving-customer-registrations"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/approving-customer-registrations

You can use Locksmith to only allow access to customers whose accounts you've manually approved. Here's how:

1. Make sure customer accounts are enabled in your Shopify settings 
2. Create a lock on the content you want to restrict
3. Add a key with the "Customer is tagged with" condition
4. Enter an "approved" tag (or whatever you want to use)
5. Save the lock

Now when a customer creates an account, it won't have access until you add the "approved" tag in their customer profile.

To pre-approve customers:

1. Use Locksmith's customer import tool under Customers > Import Customers
2. Upload a CSV of customer emails
3. Add your "approved" tag under Import Options > Customer Tags
4. Import the customers

Those customers will have access as soon as they log in.

You can also lock your registration page if you don't want customers signing up directly:

1. Search for and create a lock on the "Customer Registration" page 
2. Add your access key (like a passcode)
3. Save the lock

For more details on importing and the customer tagging UI, see the full tutorial.

### Hiding Prices and Add to Cart Buttons <a name="hiding-prices"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/hiding-prices

You can use Locksmith's manual locking mode to hide prices/Add to Cart until a customer has access. This allows browsing products but prevents purchase.

To set it up:

1. Create a lock on your products/collections
2. Add your access key(s) 
3. Enable "Manual locking" in the lock's Advanced settings
4. Edit your theme files where prices/Add to Cart appear
5. Wrap them in a Liquid condition to check the locksmith_access_granted variable

For example, to hide prices:

{% if locksmith_access_granted %}
  {{ product.price }}
{% else %}
  Sign in to see price
{% endif %}

To hide Add to Cart:

{% if locksmith_access_granted %}
  <button>Add to cart</button>
{% else %}  
  Sign in to purchase
{% endif %}

Make sure to add Locksmith's variable declaration at the top of your template:

{% capture var %}{% render 'locksmith-variables', variable: 'access_granted', scope: 'subject', subject: product %}{% endcapture %}
{% if var == 'true' %}
  {% assign locksmith_access_granted = true %}
{% else %}
  {% assign locksmith_access_granted = false %}  
{% endif %}

This requires editing Liquid, so reach out to the Locksmith team if you need help! See the full tutorial for more details and examples.

Note that some third-party apps may still expose prices in the page source. Manual locking only affects the visible storefront.

### Creating Restricted Wholesale Products <a name="locksmith-wholesale"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/locksmith-wholesale

Locksmith can help create a wholesale section in your existing store, or a wholesale-only store. This works on any Shopify plan.

For a wholesale section:

1. Duplicate your products/variants at wholesale prices
2. Create a Wholesale collection containing those products
3. Lock the Wholesale collection with customer tag/group access
4. Optional: lock your retail products to hide from wholesale 

For a wholesale-only store:

1. Create a lock on your entire store
2. Add customer tag/group access or a passcode key

If using customer accounts, you can set up account approval:

1. Add a key requiring an "approved" tag
2. Manually tag customers as "approved" in your Shopify admin
3. Or use Locksmith's bulk customer import with the tag

Managing inventory across wholesale/retail products can be tricky. You can either:

- Allocate separate inventory to each version
- Manually update retail inventory after wholesale purchases
- Use an app like Mechanic to automatically sync inventory

For more details on wholesale setup, see the full tutorial.

### Selling Digital Content on Shopify <a name="selling-digital-content"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/selling-digital-content-on-shopify

Locksmith can help you sell access to gated content in your Shopify store, like blog posts, pages, videos, or files. Here's an overview of the setup:

1. Create your restricted content 
   - Blog posts
   - Pages
   - Product pages with hidden content areas
   - Embedded videos (Vimeo, YouTube)
   - Files (PDF, audio, etc) uploaded to file sharing services
2. Create an "access product" that customers will purchase to get access
   - A one-time purchase product 
   - Or a subscription product with an app like ReCharge
3. Lock your content
   - Create a lock on your blog, page, etc
   - Add a "Customer has purchased" key for your access product
   - Optionally set an access time window
4. Ensure customers are logged in when purchasing
   - Either require login for your whole store
   - Or lock the access product to "Customers must be logged in"
5. Direct customers to your content after purchase
   - Customize the order confirmation page/email with Liquid 
   - Add a link/button to your locked content

The full tutorial covers each step in more detail, with example Liquid code for confirmation messages.

By using Shopify's built-in content tools (blogs, pages) and digital products, you can create a members-only content area that's fully integrated with your store.

#### Adding Translations to Messages#### Adding Translations to Messages <a name="adding-translations"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/adding-translations-to-your-locksmith-messages

To translate your Locksmith access prompt messages:

1. In the Locksmith message editor, use the translation filter:
   {{ "locksmith.message_key" | t }}
2. Save the lock to generate the translation key in your theme 
3. Go to Online Store > Themes > Actions > Edit Languages
4. Look for the generated "locksmith.message_key" 
5. Add translations for each language

You can translate the submit button text from your theme's language editor as well.

See the full tutorial for details on placement and formatting.

#### Automatically Managing SEO Metafields <a name="seo-metafields"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/automatically-hide-from-sitemaps-and-manage-seo-metafield

Locksmith can automatically add the seo.hidden metafield to your locked products/pages to exclude them from sitemaps and search engine indexing. 

To enable this:

1. Edit your lock
2. In the Advanced settings, check "Hide from sitemaps"
3. Save the lock

Locksmith will remove the metafield if you disable or delete the lock, or uninstall Locksmith from your store.

Note that this only applies to locks on products, collections, blogs, and pages - not variants or other resource types. 

#### Creating Private Team Areas <a name="private-team-areas"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/creating-private-team-areas

You can use Locksmith to create separate restricted areas for different teams/groups:

Option 1 - Using customer data:

1. Create a collection per group 
2. Lock each collection to the group's customer tag
3. Add collection links to your menu
4. Create a "Team Login" page to prompt login

Option 2 - Using passcodes:

1. Create a collection per group
2. Lock each collection with a group-specific passcode 
3. Create a general "Team Access" page 
4. Lock the Team Access page with all passcodes
5. Set each passcode to redirect to its collection

This allows team members to self-select their collection by entering their code.

See the full tutorial for more setup details and examples.

#### Customizing Access Denied Content <a name="customizing-access-denied"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/customising-locksmiths-access-denied-content-messages-and-redirecting-customers

The "Access Denied Content" is shown to logged-in customers who don't have access to a customer account key lock.

You can customize this message with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Liquid. A few common customizations:

Add registration fields:
{{ locksmith_customer_register_form }}

Add custom registration snippet:
{% render 'snippet-name' %}

Redirect to another page:
<script>
  window.location.replace("https://example.com");
</script>

The access denied message can help direct customers to purchase access, find more info, or complete registration.

#### Customizing Messages <a name="customizing-messages"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/customizing-messages

Nearly all customer-facing text in Locksmith is customizable using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Liquid.

You can edit messages in two places:

1. Lock-specific messages: in the lock's "Messages" section
2. Default messages: in the app Settings > Content 

Common message types:

- Guest content: Shown to logged-out customers 
- Access denied: Shown to logged-in customers without access
- Passcode prompt
- Newsletter prompt

Customize the button text and loading message from Online Store > Themes > Edit Languages.

See the full tutorial for more details and code examples.

#### Customizing the Customer Login Page <a name="customizing-login"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/customizing-the-customer-login-page

When using customer account locks, Locksmith will show the login form from your theme file. You can customize this in a few ways:

Edit form fields in customers/login.liquid:

- Add/remove fields
- Change style with CSS
- Customize error messages

Move the form:

- Use JavaScript to reposition 
- Or use a separate snippet

Hide the form:

- Wrap the form in {% comment %} tags
- Provide an alternate message/CTA

Redirect to another login page:

- Add a JavaScript redirect to the "Guest content" message

Make sure to click "Update Locksmith" after making theme changes.

#### Customizing the Passcode Form <a name="customizing-passcode-form"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/customizing-the-passcode-form

The passcode entry form has several customization options:

Add content before/after:

- Add HTML/CSS above {{ locksmith_passcode_form }}
- Use {{ locksmith_passcode_form }} to position form

Edit button text: 

- In Online Store > Themes > Edit Languages

Style specific elements:

- Target the submit button with #locksmith_passcode_submit
- Target the input with #locksmith_passcode
- Use CSS classes for layout

Replace the form entirely:

- Provide your own HTML form
- Submit passcode with JavaScript

See the full tutorial for code examples. 

The passcode form is very flexible - experiment until you find the perfect design for your store.

#### Customizing the Registration Form <a name="customizing-registration"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/customizing-the-registration-form

Locksmith uses the standard Shopify customer registration form. To collect additional info, you have a few options:

Edit the form code in customers/register.liquid:

- Add more fields 
- Fields are saved to customer notes
- Requires Liquid code changes
- Affects all customers

Use an app like Customer Fields:

- Visual form builder 
- Conditional fields per customer group
- Approval workflow
- Email notifications

Use a third-party form tool:

- Google Forms, TypeForm, etc
- Embed in Shopify page
- Manage submissions separately 
- Manually create Shopify accounts

The best approach depends on your data needs, tech skills, and budget. Tools like Customer Fields offer the most flexibility and control.

#### Disabling Locksmith for Certain Theme Files <a name="disabling-theme-files"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/disabling-locksmith-for-certain-theme-files

If you want to prevent Locksmith from modifying specific theme files:

1. Go to the Locksmith app's Settings page
2. Scroll to Advanced > "Liquid assets to ignore"
3. Enter the file paths, one per line:
   - sections/file.liquid
   - snippets/file.liquid  
   - templates/file.liquid

Locksmith will skip these files when installing/updating.

This is useful for custom code or app conflicts. If you're using the ignore list to avoid errors, let the Locksmith team know so they can investigate.

#### Editing the Confirmation Message <a name="confirmation-message"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/editing-the-confirmation-message

The "Permit if customer confirms the prompt" key shows a simple yes/no confirmation. 

To customize the message:

1. Edit the lock 
2. Modify the "Confirmation prompt" message
3. Use HTML/CSS for styling

To change the button text:

1. Go to Online Store > Themes > Edit Languages 
2. Look for the "Locksmith" section
3. Update the "Confirmation button text"
4. Repeat for each language

To add content after the button:

Use {{ locksmith_confirmation_form }} to position the button in your message.

For translations, use a placeholder and the {{ 'locksmith.key' | t }} filter in the confirmation message field.

#### Granting Time-Limited Access <a name="time-limited-access"></a>  
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/grant-access-for-a-limited-time-when-using-passcodes-or-secret-links

Passcode and secret link keys have a "Grant access for a limited time" option to automatically revoke access after a set time period.

To enable it:

1. Edit your passcode or secret link key
2. Check the "Grant access for a limited time" box 
3. Choose the number of minutes/hours/days/months/years
4. Save the lock

Access time is counted from the most recent passcode entry or secret link click. The timer resets each time the code/link is used.

Note that access is only revoked when the visitor loads a new page after time expires. Locksmith doesn't automatically refresh locked pages.

This pairs well with one-use or limited-use passcodes and links for tighter access control.

#### Granting Variant Access by Visitor Input <a name="variant-access-visitor-input"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/granting-access-to-variants-by-visitor-input

If you're using a passcode or other user-input key to lock variants, you need a way for visitors to enter their code to unlock. Locksmith doesn't do this automatically for variant locks.

The solution is a dedicated entry page:

1. Create a general passcode entry page
2. Lock the page with the same passcodes as your variants
3. Optionally set a redirect to the product on each passcode key

Now visitors can go to the entry page, punch in their code, and be sent to the product with their unlocked variants.

One entry page can handle multiple variant locks - just add a passcode key for each lock. Set the redirect on each key to point to the matching product.

This creates a smooth flow for unlocking restricted variants by audience.

#### Hiding Navigation Links <a name="hiding-navigation-links"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/hiding-navigation-links-for-locked-resources

Locksmith can hide navigation menu links to locked pages, products, collections, and blogs until the visitor has access.

To enable link hiding:

1. Edit your lock 
2. Enable "Hide any links to this [resource]"
3. Add your links to the resource to your navigation
4. Save the lock

Now unauthorized visitors will only see links they have access to.

A few notes:

- Doesn't work with mega-menus or app-controlled navs
- Affects your theme's default menus only
- Be careful with ambiguous link names 

When in doubt, test as a non-authorized customer to ensure the proper links are hidden.

#### Hiding Out-of-Stock Products <a name="hiding-out-of-stock"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/hiding-out-of-stock-products

You can dynamically hide sold-out products by locking an automated collection:

1. Create a collection with the rule "Inventory < 1"
2. Search for and lock the collection in Locksmith
3. Enable "Hide this collection and its products"
4. Save the lock

Now whenever a product sells out, it will automatically move to the locked collection and disappear from your storefront.

If you want more control over the out-of-stock UI, try an app like Locksmith's sister Mechanic for custom flows.

#### Hiding Products from Grids <a name="hiding-from-grids"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/hiding-products-from-product-grids

Locksmith can hide locked products from collection pages and search results, in addition to their direct URLs.

To enable this:

1. Edit your product/collection lock
2. In the lock settings, check "Hide from search results and other product grids" 
3. Save the lock

A few notes:

- Only works with Shopify's default search and collection pages
- May not work with third-party filtering/search apps
- Can cause gaps in your collections (fill with more products or enable pagination)

Test on your collections and search pages to confirm the behavior.

#### Hiding the Store Header and Footer <a name="hiding-header-footer"></a>  
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/how-do-i-hide-my-shopify-stores-header-and-footer

Locksmith doesn't have a built-in way to hide your store's header and footer on locked pages. However, you can achieve this with some Liquid conditionals in your theme files.

For example, to show the header only to logged-in customers:

{% if customer %}
  {% section 'header' %}  
{% endif %}

To check for a specific tag:

{% if customer.tags contains 'tag_name' %}
  {% section 'header' %}
{% endif %}

Or using Locksmith's access variables:

{% if locksmith_access_granted %}
  {% section 'header' %}  
{% endif %}

This requires adding Locksmith's variable declaration and editing your theme.liquid and other layout files.

If you're not comfortable with Liquid, consider hiring a Shopify expert to implement this customization.

#### Importing Customers in Bulk <a name="importing-customers"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/importing-customers-in-bulk

Locksmith has a bulk customer import tool to help create accounts for your authorized customers. 

To use it:

1. Go to Customers > Import Customers
2. Choose your import method:
   - Paste in email addresses (one per line) 
   - Upload a CSV file
3. Set import options:
   - Add tags to imported customers
   - Set a default password
4. Review the import preview
5. Click "Start Import"

Your imported customers will be added as Shopify customer accounts.

The CSV import supports standard Shopify customer fields like:

- Email (required)
- First/last name
- Accepts marketing 
- Tags
- Password

See the full tutorial for accepted fields and CSV formatting tips.

#### Input Lists <a name="input-lists"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/input-lists

Input lists allow you to use large collections of passcodes, secret links, and emails with Locksmith. They're useful for managing access at scale.

To create an input list:

1. Add your values to a Google Sheet, CSV, TXT, or JSON file 
2. Put the file URL in Locksmith's Settings > Input Lists
3. Choose case-sensitivity and usage limit options
4. Save the list

Your list will automatically sync to pull in new values. For non-Google sources, sync daily or manually with the "Sync now" button.

Then to use the list in a lock:

1. Add a passcode, secret link, or customer email key
2. Select the "...from an input list" option
3. Choose your list from the dropdown
4. Save the lock

Now Locksmith will check customer-entered values against your list to grant access.

See the full tutorial for file formatting, syncing, and key condition setup details.

#### Klaviyo Integration <a name="klaviyo"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/klaviyo

Locksmith integrates with Klaviyo to let you collect emails and grant access based on Klaviyo list membership.

To set up the Klaviyo key:

1. Create a Klaviyo account and list
2. Edit your lock and add a new key
3. Select "Customer subscribes to your Klaviyo list" 
4. Enter your Klaviyo private API key
5. Choose your list
6. Customize the signup prompt 
7. Save the lock

Now when a visitor enters their email, Locksmith will add them to your Klaviyo list and unlock the content. Customers already on the list will be let through immediately.

For the API key, go to your Klaviyo account settings, then click "API Keys" to generate a new private key.

The Klaviyo key also has a "grant access only if already subscribed" option to use your list as a pre-approval gate instead of a signup form.

#### Liquid Locking Basics <a name="liquid-locking-basics"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/liquid-locking-basics

Liquid locks allow you to lock resources that aren't searchable in Locksmith, or create custom locking conditions using the Liquid templating language.

To create a Liquid lock:

1. Search for "Liquid" in the Locksmith lock creator
2. Select "Start a Liquid lock"
3. In the "Liquid condition" box, enter the Liquid that evaluates to true when the page should be locked
4. Optionally use the "Liquid prelude" box to define variables or set up the condition
5. Save the lock and add keys as normal

A few examples:

Lock all pages with a certain title:
{%Lock all pages with a certain title:
{% if page.title contains 'VIP' %}

Lock all pages using a specific template:
{% if page.template == 'page.vip' %} 

Lock based on URL:
{% if canonical_url contains 'exclusive' %}

You can use any Liquid logic that returns true/false based on the current page or other variables.

The prelude is useful for defining lists of pages to match against or doing more complex logic:

{% assign locked_pages = 'page1,page2' | split: ',' %}
{% if locked_pages contains page.handle %}
  {% assign page_locked = true %}
{% endif %}

Then in your condition:
{% if page_locked %}

Using Liquid opens up advanced locking scenarios not possible with the standard lock types. The full Shopify Liquid reference is available for crafting your conditions.

See the full tutorial for more examples and tips. Liquid locks are powerful but do require some Liquid knowledge to set up.

#### Locking Blog Posts <a name="locking-blog-posts"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/locking-blog-posts

To lock an individual blog post/article:

1. In your Shopify admin, add a tag to the article
2. In Locksmith, search for the article tag
3. Select the "Articles tagged..." option
4. Save the lock and add keys

If the tag doesn't show up, try clicking "Update Locksmith" from the app's Help page to refresh the search index.

You can still lock an entire blog at once by searching for the blog title. But article tags allow more granular locking within a blog.

#### Locking Multiple Pages at Once <a name="locking-multiple-pages"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/locking-multiple-pages-at-once

Shopify doesn't have bulk selection for pages like it does for products. To lock multiple pages at once, use a Liquid lock with conditions to match your pages.

Lock all pages with a title containing "VIP":
{% if page.title contains 'VIP' %}

Lock all pages using a specific template:
{% if page.template == 'page.vip' %}

Lock a specific set of pages:

{% assign locked_pages = 'page1,page2' | split: ',' %}
{% if locked_pages contains page.handle %}

You can use any Liquid logic that evaluates to true when a page should be locked.

Combine multiple conditions in the prelude, then simplify the main condition to a single variable:

{% assign page_locked = false %}
{% if page.title contains 'VIP' %}
  {% assign page_locked = true %}
{% endif %}
{% if page.template == 'page.vip' %}
  {% assign page_locked = true %}  
{% endif %}

{% if page_locked %}

This approach saves you from making individual locks for each page. See the full tutorial for more Liquid lock examples.

#### Locking Products by Tag <a name="locking-by-tag"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/locking-products-by-tag

To lock products with a specific tag:

1. In your Shopify admin, create a new automated collection 
2. Set the condition to match your product tag
3. Save the collection
4. In Locksmith, search for and lock the collection
5. Enable "Also protect products in this collection"

Now products with that tag will automatically be added to the locked collection.

If you want to still show the products in other collections, disable the "Hide from search and lists" lock option.

Using an automated collection saves you from making individual locks for each product. Whenever you tag a new product, it will automatically be protected.

#### Locking Products by Vendor <a name="locking-by-vendor"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/locking-products-by-vendor

To lock all products from a specific vendor:

1. In Locksmith, search for the vendor name
2. Select the "Products from [vendor]" option 
3. Save the lock and add keys
4. Enable "Hide this vendor and their products" if desired

You can also create a vendor-specific collection:

1. In Shopify, create an automated collection
2. Set the condition to match your vendor name
3. In Locksmith, search for and lock the collection
4. Enable "Also protect products in this collection"

The vendor lock is simpler but the collection approach lets you customize the vendor's landing page and what products are included.

Choose the method that fits your store organization and access control needs.

#### Locking the Customer Registration Form <a name="locking-registration"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/locking-the-customer-registration-form

You can lock your customer registration form to restrict signups:

1. In Locksmith, search for "registration" 
2. Select the "Customer Registration" page
3. Save the lock and add keys (usually a passcode)

Now only visitors with the key can access the registration form.

This is useful for creating a manual approval flow:

1. Lock registration 
2. Provide the passcode to approved customers
3. Customers sign up with the code
4. Optionally tag new accounts for access to other locks

Note that customer account locks won't work on the registration form itself, as the visitor won't be logged in yet. Use a passcode or Liquid lock instead.

#### Locking the Home Page <a name="locking-home-page"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/locking-the-home-page

There are two ways to lock your Shopify store's home page.

1. Lock your entire store:

- Search for and lock "Entire store" in Locksmith
- In the lock settings, disable "Allow access to the home page"
- Add keys to allow access

2. Lock the home page only:

- In Locksmith, search for "Liquid"
- Select "Start a Liquid lock"
- Enter {% if template == 'index' %} in the Liquid condition box
- Save the lock and add keys

If you want to lock most of your store but keep the home page public, use the first method but leave "Allow access to home page" enabled.

For a fully locked store, disable that option. 

To just lock the home page content, use the template condition in a Liquid lock.

#### Locking the Search Results Page <a name="locking-search-results"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/locking-the-search-results-page-in-your-store

To lock your search results:

1. In Locksmith, search for "search"
2. Select the "Search" page from the results
3. Save the lock and add keys

This will lock your /search page and any searches made from there.

If your theme has search boxes elsewhere (header, footer, etc), you can lock those with Liquid:

{% include 'locksmith-variables', locksmith_scope: 'search' %}
{% if locksmith_access_granted %}
  // search box code
{% endif %} 

Paste that in your search box snippet or section file.

Locking search results can be useful for wholesale stores or membership areas. Note that Locksmith can't filter search suggestions, only the results page.

#### Locking Variants <a name="locking-variants"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/locking-variants

Locksmith can lock individual product variants by their option values:

1. In Locksmith, search for your variant name 
2. Select the matching variant from the results
3. Save the lock and add keys

This will hide the variant option from unauthorized visitors. Locked variants are also hidden on collection pages and in search results.

A few notes:

- Make sure to "Update Locksmith" from the app's Help page if your variant isn't showing up in search
- Variant locks work best when products only have a few options (less than 100 total variants)
- Incompatible with some other apps that modify the variant selector
- Requires code changes to add a passcode/login form to unlock

When a variant is locked, visitors won't see the option at all until they unlock it. The rest of the product is still visible.

This is useful for wholesale pricing, member-only variants, or restricting access to certain options.

See the full variant locking tutorial for details on setup, compatibility, and advanced use cases.

#### Mailchimp Integration <a name="mailchimp"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/mailchimp

Locksmith integrates with Mailchimp to let you collect emails and build your subscriber list.

To set up the Mailchimp key:

1. Create a Mailchimp account and list
2. Edit your lock and add a new key
3. Select "Customer subscribes to your Mailchimp list"
4. Connect your Mailchimp account 
5. Choose your list
6. Customize the signup prompt
7. Save the lock

Now visitors will have to enter their email and be added to your Mailchimp list to unlock the content.

If a visitor is already subscribed, they'll be let through immediately without being added again.

To see your Locksmith signups in Mailchimp:

1. Create a new Mailchimp segment
2. Set the condition to "OPTIN_TIME is after [lock creation date]" 
3. Save the segment

This will show all subscribers who joined after you added the Mailchimp key to your lock.

Mailchimp is a great way to gather leads while protecting content. Integrate it with your email marketing strategy for best results.

#### Making a Product Accessible Only via Direct Link <a name="exclusive-link-access"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/making-a-product-accessible-exclusively-from-the-direct-product-link

To quietly launch a product or create an unlisted item:

1. In Locksmith, search for and lock the product 
2. Add a Liquid key with:
   {% if template == 'product' %}
3. Enable "Hide this product from search and lists"
4. Save the lock

Now the product will only be accessible via its direct URL. It won't appear in collections or search.

This is different from Locksmith's secret link keys. Those require a special link with a key appended. The Liquid key just checks if you're on the product page.

You can use this same technique for pages and other resources too. Just change the template condition:

- collection: {% if template == 'collection' %}
- page: {% if template == 'page' %}
- article: {% if template == 'article' %}
- blog: {% if template == 'blog' %}

If it doesn't work, your theme might use a non-standard template name. Check the theme files and adjust the condition to match.

#### Manual Mode <a name="manual-mode-tutorial"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/manual-mode

Locksmith's manual locking mode lets you hide specific parts of a page (like price or Add to Cart buttons) instead of the whole page.

To enable manual locking:

1. Create a lock on your products/collections 
2. In the lock's Advanced settings, enable "Manual locking"
3. Add your access keys
4. Edit your theme code where you want to hide content

In your Liquid templates, wrap the content to hide in a Locksmith access condition:

{% if locksmith_access_granted %}
  // your content
{% endif %}

To set the access variables, include this at the top of your template:

{% capture var %}{% render 'locksmith-variables', variable: 'access_granted', scope: 'subject', subject: product %}{% endcapture %}
{% if var == 'true' %}
  {% assign locksmith_access_granted = true %}
{% else %}
  {% assign locksmith_access_granted = false %}
{% endif %}

Now content between the {% if %} tags will only show when the visitor has access.

You can also show alternate content in an {% else %} clause:

{% if locksmith_access_granted %}
  // main content
{% else %}
  // alternate restricted content  
{% endif %}

Common use cases:

- Hide prices 
- Hide Add to Cart buttons
- Show a custom login/signup prompt
- Display excerpts or thumbnails of restricted content

Manual locking takes more setup than standard locks, but offers fine-grained control. It's a powerful way to tease content and convert visitors.

See the full manual mode tutorial for step-by-step guides and more use case ideas.

#### Offering Different Variants by Postal Code <a name="variants-by-postal-code"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/offering-different-variants-by-postal-code

You can use Locksmith to show different product variants based on the visitor's entered postal code. This is useful for local delivery or in-store pickup options.

Here's how to set it up:

1. Add a "Postal code" option to your product variants
2. Create a variant for each postal code you want to support
3. Lock each variant with a passcode key set to the postal code value
4. Create a general lock on your whole store or collection
5. Add a "many passcodes" key to the general lock with all your postal codes

Now when a visitor enters their postal code on the general lock page, it will unlock the matching variant on your product page.

The general lock acts as a "switching station" to direct visitors to the right local variant.

To see a live example, check out the demo store linked in the full tutorial (password: locksmith).

This technique combines variant and passcode locking for a seamless location-based shopping experience.

#### Passcode-Specific Redirects <a name="passcode-redirects"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/passcode-specific-redirects

You can redirect visitors to different pages after they enter a passcode, based on which code they used.

To set this up:

1. Edit your lock
2. Add multiple passcode keys, each with a different passcode value
3. For each key, click the "..." menu 
4. Enter the URL to redirect to in the "Redirect URL" field
5. Save the lock

Now when a visitor enters a passcode, they'll be sent to the corresponding link for that key.

This is useful for sending customers to personalized landing pages or specific products after signup.

A few notes:

- Don't set the redirect to a page that's already locked, or you'll create a loop
- Combine with one-use or limited-use passcodes for access control
- Test each redirect carefully

Used creatively, passcode redirects can guide visitors through an exclusive content journey.

See the full tutorial for visual examples and more use case ideas.

#### Setting Up Multiple Price Tiers <a name="price-tiers"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/price-tiers

Locksmith can help you create multiple price levels (like wholesale and retail) on one storefront:

1. Duplicate your products at the new price, or add a new price variant
2. Create a collection for each price tier
3. Lock each collection to its customer group
4. Optional: lock retail products for logged-in wholesale customers

To restrict access:

- Use customer tags for a manual approval flow
- Or use Locksmith's passcode lock for self-serve access

For products with many variants, use variant locking instead of full duplicates:

1. Add a "Price tier" option like "Wholesale" and "Retail" 
2. Create a variant for each tier
3. Lock each variant to its customer group

This is more compact but can be harder to manage for stores with complex variant setups already.

Inventory management is key with multiple price tiers. You can either:

- Use separate SKUs and inventory for each tier
- Manage retail inventory manually 
- Use an app like Mechanic to sync inventory

Locksmith's "pay what feels good" pricing can help keep costs down when using multiple apps.

See the full price tier tutorial for more details on collection vs variant locking, customer management, and inventory strategies.

#### Protecting Against Bots <a name="bot-protection"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/protecting-against-bots

Locksmith alone cannot fully prevent bots and resellers, due to Shopify's direct checkout links. However, you can use a workaround:

1. Increase your public prices to deter bots
2. Create a private discount code to bring prices back down
3. Share the code only with approved customers
4. Optionally use Locksmith to hide prices entirely until logged in

To create a private discount:

1. In your Shopify admin, go to Discounts > Create Discount
2. Configure your discount amount
3. Set customer eligibility to specific tagged customers only
4. Activate the discount 

Then give the code to customers you want to allow purchasing.

Locksmith can help hide prices from the public to avoid confusion:

1. Lock your products or collections2. Enable "Manual locking" in the lock's Advanced settings
3. Edit your theme to wrap prices in a Locksmith access check:

{% if locksmith_access_granted %}
  {{ product.price | money }}
{% else %}  
  Sign in for pricing
{% endif %}

4. Include the Locksmith variable declaration at the top of the template:

{% capture var %}{% render 'locksmith-variables', variable: 'access_granted', scope: 'subject', subject: product %}{% endcapture %}
{% if var == 'true' %}
  {% assign locksmith_access_granted = true %}  
{% else %}
  {% assign locksmith_access_granted = false %}
{% endif %}

5. Customize your "else" message to direct customers to sign in or request the discount code

This hides prices from bots while still allowing approved customers to purchase at the normal rate.

It's not a complete bot solution, but it's a good workaround using Shopify's built-in discounts and Locksmith's content restriction.

Test carefully and monitor for any bot activity. Reach out to the Locksmith team for more guidance.

#### ReCharge Integration <a name="recharge"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/recharge

You can use Locksmith with ReCharge to lock content for active subscribers only. This is great for member areas, exclusive products, or premium content.

First, set up your ReCharge subscription product:

1. Install ReCharge and configure your subscription settings
2. Create a subscription product (digital or physical) 
3. Note the "Active Subscriber" tag that ReCharge adds

Then lock your content in Locksmith:

1. Create a lock on your subscriber-only products, pages, etc.
2. Add a key with "Customer is tagged with Active Subscriber"
3. Save the lock

Now only active ReCharge subscribers will be able to access the locked content. The "Active Subscriber" tag is automatically added and removed as customers subscribe and unsubscribe.

For multiple membership tiers:

1. Create a ReCharge subscription product for each tier
2. Tag each product with its tier name
3. Lock content for each tier separately 
4. Use the "Customer has purchased [tier] product in the last [subscription period]" key

This checks if the customer has an active subscription to a specific product, not just any ReCharge subscription.

Locksmith and ReCharge make it easy to gate content and generate recurring revenue from your Shopify store. Experiment with different membership models and exclusive perks.

#### Redirecting Using Locksmith <a name="redirecting"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/redirecting-using-locksmith

Locksmith has a few ways to redirect visitors:

Immediately redirect away from a locked page:

1. Edit your lock 
2. In the lock messages, add a JavaScript redirect:

<script>
  window.location.href = 'https://example.com/path'; 
</script>

3. Optionally customize the "Access denied" message for logged-in visitors

Now all traffic to that locked page will be sent to the new URL. Useful for sending members to a login page or non-members to an upgrade prompt.

Redirect after unlocking content:

1. Edit your lock and open a key setting
2. Click the "..." menu in the top right
3. Enter the URL to redirect to in the "Redirect URL" field
4. Save the lock

When a visitor uses that key to unlock the content, they'll be redirected to the specified page.

This is commonly used with passcode keys to send visitors to personalized pages after entering their unique code.

A few notes:

- Don't redirect to another locked page or you risk a loop
- Combine with limited-use keys for access control
- Test all redirects thoroughly 

Used strategically, redirects can guide visitors through a desired content flow or funnel traffic to important pages.

See the full redirects tutorial for more setup details and examples.

#### Restricting to New Customers Only <a name="new-customers-only"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/restricting-a-product-so-that-it-can-only-be-purchased-by-new-customers

You can use Locksmith to restrict a product to first-time buyers only:

1. Lock the product 
2. Add a key with "Customer is signed in"
3. Add a second key with "Customer has not purchased any product" 
4. Set the second key to check all past orders
5. Customize the lock message to prompt sign-in

Now only signed-in customers without any previous orders can purchase the product. 

This is great for welcome offers, first-time buyer discounts, or introductory sizes.

A few things to note:

- Requires customer accounts to be enabled 
- Won't work for guest checkouts
- Counts all past orders, not just orders containing the locked product

You can customize the "Access denied" lock message to explain the restriction and prompt account creation.

If you want to limit to one purchase of the specific product instead of one purchase ever, use the "Customer has not purchased [product]" key instead.

Test the flow as a new and returning customer to make sure it's working as intended. Reach out to the Locksmith team for help if needed.

#### Restricting Checkout from the Cart <a name="restricting-checkout"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/restricting-checkout-from-the-cart

Locksmith can restrict access to the checkout button on your cart page. This is useful for wholesale stores, membership areas, or setting order minimums.

To set it up:

1. In Locksmith, search for "cart" and create a cart lock
2. Add your restriction key, like "Customer is tagged" or "Cart value is at least $X" 
3. Enable "Manual locking" in the lock's Advanced settings
4. Edit your cart.liquid or cart-template.liquid theme file
5. Wrap the checkout button in a Locksmith condition:

{% if locksmith_access_granted %}
  <button>Check out</button>
{% else %}
  <p>You must log in to check out.</p>
{% endif %}

6. Add the Locksmith variable declaration at the top of the file:

{% capture var %}{% render 'locksmith-variables', variable: 'access_granted', scope: 'subject', subject: cart %}{% endcapture %}
{% if var == 'true' %}
  {% assign locksmith_access_granted = true %}
{% else %}
  {% assign locksmith_access_granted = false %}  
{% endif %}

Now the checkout button will only show for visitors who meet your key conditions. Everyone else sees the alternate message.

A few notes:

- Only works with Shopify's default cart page, not ajax carts or special cart drawers
- Can't restrict one-click checkout buttons that skip the cart
- Requires theme edits, so duplicate your theme first

You can still let visitors add items to cart and adjust quantities. The lock only covers the final checkout action.

Customize your "else" message to explain the checkout conditions and guide visitors to complete them.

#### Restricting Customers to a Specific Collection <a name="restricting-to-collection"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/restricting-customers-to-a-specific-collection

You can use Locksmith to restrict customers to only access a single collection:

1. Create your limited-access collection 
2. Lock the collection to your VIP customer tag or group
3. Add the "Force open other locks" setting to the collection lock
4. Create a separate lock for your whole store
5. Add a key to the store lock for "Customer is not tagged VIP"

Now VIP customers will only see their special collection, while other customers can browse the rest of the store.

The "force open" setting on the collection lock overrides the store lock for VIP members.

A few extra steps for a smooth customer experience:

- Add a "members area" link to your store menu that goes to the VIP collection
- Customize your store lock message to remove or explain the members link for non-VIPs
- Hide the VIP collection from search and grid results

This setup is great for exclusive product launches, member-only sales, or selling to specific customer groups.

You can also flip it to have a public collection and VIP-locked rest of store. Just adjust your key logic.

Make sure to test as both a VIP and non-VIP customer to confirm the correct access. Reach out to the Locksmith team if you need any help!

#### Restricting Mixed Cart Products <a name="restricting-mixed-carts"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/restricting-the-cart-for-mixed-products-and-combinations-of-products

Locksmith can restrict checkout based on combinations of items in the cart, like blocking mixed wholesale and retail products.

The "Has a certain product in cart" key has a "Look for products matching..." field to specify what products to check for.

You can use product titles, SKUs, or tags in this field. For example:

- title:Wholesale Shirt 
- tag:wholesale
- sku:123

To block mixed wholesale and retail items:

1. Tag all your wholesale products with "wholesale"
2. Tag all your retail products with "retail" 
3. Create a cart lock with 3 key combinations:
   - Allow if has wholesale items AND not retail 
   - Allow if has retail items AND not wholesale
   - Allow if has neither wholesale nor retail items

The first key uses two "Has product in cart" conditions:
- "tag:wholesale" 
- "tag:retail" (inverted) 

The second is the reverse logic. 

The third looks for the absence of both tags.

This ensures customers can only check out with all wholesale, all retail, or non-tagged products. No mixing allowed.

You can extend this concept to any mutually-exclusive product categories, like:

- Buyer-specific items
- Age-restricted products
- Subscription vs one-time purchase 

If a customer tries to check out a blocked combination, they'll hit the cart lock. Customize the lock message to explain the restrictions.

You can also use a cart lock with no keys to completely block checkout until the cart is updated.

Experiment with creative cart restrictions to curate the checkout experience. Reach out to Locksmith support for more advanced use cases.

#### Shopify Markets Integration <a name="shopify-markets"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/shopify-markets

You can use Locksmith to show different content to customers in different Shopify Markets. This is great for currency-specific pricing or market-specific product catalogs.

First, set up your markets in Shopify:

1. Enable and configure international domains or subfolders
2. Assign countries to each market
3. Customize market settings like currency

Then create your market-specific content:

1. Duplicate products or create market-specific variants 
2. Organize market products into collections

Finally, lock the content in Locksmith:

1. Create a lock for each market's products/collections
2. Use the "Customer is visiting from a certain domain" key for domain-based markets 
3. Or use a Liquid key with {% if request.locale.root_url == '/market' %} for subfolder-based markets
4. Save each lock

Now customers will only see the products and prices for their active market. No need for separate stores or complex theme logic.

A few tips:

- Use the "force open other locks" setting if products appear in multiple markets
- Customize the lock messages to direct customers to the right market or explain restrictions
- Test your locks by visiting your store through each market domain/subfolder 

With a bit of setup, Locksmith and Shopify Markets can power a seamless multi-region shopping experience from one store.

As always, contact the Locksmith team for help with any advanced use cases!

#### Testing on Unpublished Themes <a name="testing-unpublished-themes"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/testing-locksmith-on-unpublished-themes

By default, Locksmith only works on your live published theme. But you can manually install it on unpublished themes for testing:

1. In the Locksmith app, go to the Help page
2. Open the "Unpublished themes" section 
3. Click "Install" next to the theme you want to test
4. Click the "Preview" link to open the theme preview

Locksmith will copy your lock config to the unpublished theme. 

Limitations:

- You need to reinstall every time you update your locks
- Some features like Liquid locks may not work in preview mode
- Cart and customer state don't carry over from the live store

But installing on unpublished themes is still useful for:

- Testing new theme styles with existing locks
- Customizing the locked page content before going live
- Debugging theme-specific issues

Just remember to QA your setup again once the theme is published.

To uninstall Locksmith from an unpublished theme:

1. Go to the Locksmith Help page
2. Open "Unpublished themes" 
3. Click "Uninstall" for the theme

This removes Locksmith's script tags and content from the theme files.

Always uninstall before deleting a theme, or the Locksmith snippets will be left behind. Reach out to the team for help cleaning up an incomplete uninstall.

Happy theme testing!

#### Using Klaviyo as an Access Control List <a name="klaviyo-access-control"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/tutorials/more/use-klaviyo-as-an-access-control-list

In addition to collecting email signups, Locksmith's Klaviyo key can grant or deny access based on the visitor's existing Klaviyo list subscriptions.

This is useful for:

- Giving early access to engaged subscribers
- Restricting content to a VIP list
- Validating registrations against a known list

To set it up:

1. Create your lock 
2. Add a Klaviyo key
3. Connect your Klaviyo account and choose your list
4. Check the "Only grant access if the customer is already on this list" option
5. Customize the lock message
6. Save the lock

Now when a visitor enters their email, Locksmith will check if they're already on your selected Klaviyo list. If they are, they get immediate access. If not, they're denied.

This check is based on the email address only, not Klaviyo's double opt-in status. So it works even if you have double opt-in enabled.

A few use case ideas:

- Pre-launch signups: Build your list, then grant the early birds special access
- Membership tiers: Tag subscribers in Klaviyo, then use those tags to create access levels
- Wholesale: Upload customer emails to a private Klaviyo list to validate wholesale registrations

Using Klaviyo as your "source of truth" keeps your access control in sync with your email marketing.

Just remember to update your lock messages to ask for an email without promising a signup incentive. Something like "Enter your email to unlock this exclusive content."

You can combine the Klaviyo ACL key with other conditions like customer tags for even more granular access rules. Experiment and see what works for your audience!

## FAQs <a name="faqs"></a>

### Hiding Content from In-Store Search <a name="faq-search-hiding"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/can-locksmith-hide-content-from-my-in-store-search

Locksmith can hide products from your store's native search by checking the "Hide from search" option on your product or collection lock.

This will remove the items from search suggestions and results pages for customers who don't have access through your lock.

However, a few limitations:

- Only works with Shopify's default search, not third-party search apps
- Doesn't work with search-as-you-type or "predictive" search 
- Won't hide products from search in other sales channels like the Wholesale store

If you're using a custom search solution, check with that app's support team for help hiding Locksmith-protected content. Many have their own tagging or exclusion options.

For predictive search, your only option is to disable the feature entirely from your theme settings. Locksmith can't filter those dynamic results.

If search privacy is critical for your store, consider replacing your search bar with a link to the dedicated /search page, which Locksmith can fully lock.

You can also use the "Hide from sitemaps" lock option to remove products from search engine results and the Shopify sitemap.

### Blank Spaces in Collections/Searches <a name="faq-blank-spaces"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/faq-i-see-blank-spaces-in-my-collections-and-or-searches-when-locking

If you're hiding products from collections and search with Locksmith, you may end up with blank spaces or partially-empty pages.

This happens because Shopify loads afixed number of products per page, and Locksmith can only filter out hidden products after the page loads. It can't reshuffle the remaining products to fill gaps.

A few workarounds:

1. Increase the products per page in your theme settings (up to 50). This reduces gaps and may eliminate them entirely if you have fewer than 50 products per collection.

2. Use separate locked and public collections instead of mixing. Send authorized customers to the locked collections via direct links or the nav menu. 

3. Install an infinite scroll app. Many of these will automatically load the next page of products when gaps appear, creating a seamless browsing experience.

4. Create alternate "public" collections using Shopify's exclude rules to omit hidden products. Customize your menus and theme links to point to these instead of the full collections.

The right approach depends on your catalog setup and store traffic. You may need to experiment a bit.

For the "All" collection in your nav menu, consider making a manual "Public Products" collection to replace it. This avoids the blank space issue entirely.

Some themes also have special collection sections on the homepage or other core pages. Locksmith can't filter these, but you can use alternate public collections and customize the theme code to reference those instead.

If you need help, the Locksmith team is always happy to suggest a solution for your specific store. Just reach out!

### Administrator Can't Access Locked Content <a name="faq-admin-access"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/im-the-administrator-of-my-site-and-cannot-access

If you're the store owner and you've accidentally locked yourself out of your own content:

1. Make sure you're using the Shopify admin to edit and preview your store, not just visiting it like a customer. Locksmith doesn't apply to the admin.

2. If you're browsing your store as a customer, create a customer account for yourself and add an "admin" tag to it.

3. Create a new lock with a Liquid condition that checks for {% if customer.tags contains "admin" %}

4. Add an "Always allow" key to the admin lock.

Now you can log into your customer account to bypass any locks when previewing your store.

If you're still having trouble, remember that Locksmith doesn't run in theme editor mode. You can always enter the theme editor to access locked pages.

As a last resort, you can uninstall Locksmith from the app settings to remove all active locks. Just be sure to remove any lingering snippets from your theme files as well.

Hopefully it doesn't come to that! The admin tag trick is usually enough to restore access.

It's a good idea to set up an admin override lock whenever you start using Locksmith, to avoid future lockouts. Stay safe out there!

### Locksmith Not Working with Page Builder Apps <a name="faq-page-builders"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/locksmith-is-not-working-with-my-page-builder-app

Locksmith can conflict with page builder apps like GemPages or Shogun, especially when using Locksmith's manual locking mode.

Page builders work by entirely replacing your theme's templates with their own customized versions. This can overwrite or break Locksmith's protection.

If you're using a page builder app, a few tips:

- Stick to Locksmith's automatic full-page locks. Don't use manual locking snippets.
- Don't try to lock builder-created pages directly. Instead, lock the content those pages link to.
- If you need to edit a locked page with the builder, temporarily disable the lock or put it in test mode.
- Contact the page builder's support team for help. They may have Locksmith-specific tips.

In general, Locksmith works best with standard Shopify pages and theme templates. The more custom your setup, the trickier it can be to integrate protection.

If you're considering a page builder app, try to choose one that plays well with other Shopify apps. Read reviews and support documentation to see if they mention Locksmith or content restriction.

You can also ask the Locksmith team for advice. They keep up with the latest app compatibility news.

But in general, keep your page builder and Locksmith setups separate as much as possible. Use the builder for fancy landing pages and public content, and stick to regular pages for your Locksmith-protected members area or wholesale store.

With a little planning, you can have the best of both worlds!

### What to Do if Site is Loading Slowly <a name="faq-slow-loading"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/what-should-i-do-if-my-site-is-loading-slowly

If your store slows down after installing Locksmith, don't panic! A few common culprits:

1. Too many locks or keys. Each lock and key adds a bit of weight to your pages. If you have dozens or hundreds, it can add up. Try consolidating or simplifying your setup.

2. Locks on every page. Locksmith has to check the access conditions on every locked page. If your whole site is locked, that's a lot of checks. Consider locking just key pages instead.

3. Locks in navigation menus. The "hide links" lock option is powerful, but can slow down your nav menu if you have a ton of links. Use it sparingly.

4. Multiple locks on the same content. Each lock adds another layer of checks. If you have products in multiple locked collections, try to limit it to one lock per product.

5. App conflicts. Some apps, like builder tools or optimization plugins, can interfere with Locksmith's code. Check if the issue started after installing another app.

If none of those apply, try temporarily disabling Locksmith from the app preferences. If that fixes it, you know Locksmith is involved. If not, the issue is probably elsewhere.

You can also use Locksmith's "Liquid assets to ignore" setting to exclude certain theme files from protection. That can help isolate problem areas.

If you're still stuck, the Locksmith team is happy to dive in and do a speed audit on your store. They can usually spot the bottleneck pretty quickly.

In most cases, a few tweaks to your lock setup is all it takes to get back up to speed. Don't let a little slowdown stop you from protecting your content!

### Why Aren't My Locks Working? <a name="faq-locks-not-working"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/why-arent-my-locks-working

If your Locksmith locks suddenly stop working, here's a quick troubleshooting checklist:

1. Is Locksmith up to date? Whenever you change themes, you need to update Locksmith from the app's "Help" page. Old or missing code can break your locks.

2. Is the page password-protected in Shopify? Locksmith can't bypass Shopify's built-in password page. Remove the password in your Shopify preferences.

3. Are you logged in? If you've entered a valid passcode or used a secret link, Locksmith remembers your access. Use an incognito browser window to test as a new visitor.

4. Is your passcode correct? Double-check spelling and capitalization. Passcodes are case-sensitive.

5. Is your secret link correct? Make sure the URL is exact, with no extra spaces or missing characters. 

6. Is the lock enabled? Check the lock status in the Locksmith app. A disabled lock won't protect anything.

7. Is the lock filtered to the right content? Double-check the lock's "Applies to" settings to make sure it's covering the page or products you expect.

8. Are your key conditions correct? Read through your keys carefully to spot any unintended "Always allow" conditions or missing restrictions.

9. Is the customer account tagged correctly? If using customer tags, make sure the account has the exact tag specified in your key, with no typos.

10. Is the product available in the right collection or market? Locksmith can only protect products that are visible in the Online Store sales channel. 

If you're still seeing issues, try temporarily disabling all of your locks. If that fixes it, re-enable them one by one until you find the problem lock.

You can also use the Locksmith app's "test mode" to preview your lock setup without affecting real customers.

If all else fails, contact the Locksmith support team. They can usually spot the issue pretty quickly and get you back up and running.

Don't let a little lock trouble stop you from protecting your store! With a bit of detective work, you'll be back in business in no time.

#### App Not Loading <a name="faq-app-not-loading"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/more/app-not-loading

If the Locksmith app won't load in your browser:

1. Check the Locksmith status page for any known issues 
2. Try loading the app URL directly
3. Try a private/incognito browser window
4. Try a different browser or device
5. Try a different internet connection

If none of those work, contact the Locksmith team with details like:

- How far you got in the troubleshooting steps
- Screenshots of any error messages
- Your public IP and browser information

#### Locking Shopify's Public JSON API <a name="faq-json-api"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/more/can-locksmith-lock-shopifys-public-json-api-for-my-online-store

Locksmith cannot restrict access to your store's public Shopify API (like the /products.json endpoint). This API is provided by Shopify and is integral to many themes and apps.

If you absolutely need to lock down your JSON API, you'd need to use a custom app proxy or Shopify's API firewall. But this can break theme features and third-party integrations, so it's not recommended.

For most stores, the public API is not a security concern. The data it exposes is already visible on your site. But if you're dealing with sensitive information, talk to a Shopify Plus expert about custom solutions.

#### Protecting Shipping/Billing Methods or Coupon Codes <a name="faq-shipping-billing-coupons"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/more/can-locksmith-protect-shipping-methods-billing-methods-or-coupon-codes

Locksmith cannot restrict shipping options, payment methods, or discount codes. These are all controlled by Shopify's checkout, which is separate from the Online Store where Locksmith lives.

If you need to offer different shipping or payment options to different customers, your best bet is to use Shopify's customer groups and checkout customization features. These are only available on higher-tier plans.

For unique coupon codes, consider using a Shopify app that generates single-use or customer-specific discount codes. Then distribute the codes to your VIP members or wholesale buyers.

You can still use Locksmith to hide products and collections until checkout. But anything past the cart page is out of Locksmith's hands.

If you have questions about checkout customization, try asking the Shopify support team. They can walk you through the options for your store's plan and setup.

#### Changing Customer Redirect After Registration <a name="faq-registration-redirect"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/more/how-do-i-change-where-customers-are-redirected-to-after-registration-on-shopify

By default, Shopify sends new customers to their account page after registration. To change this:

1. Edit your theme's "customers/register.liquid" template file 
2. Add a hidden "return_to" input field with your redirect URL:

<input type="hidden" name="return_to" value="/pages/welcome">

3. Save and test

If you're using Locksmith to show registration on a locked page, you can use this trick to redirect back to the original page:

1. Edit your lock's "Access denied" message
2. Add this code:

<input type="hidden" name="return_to" value="{{ canonical_url }}">

This will send new registrants back to the page they were trying to access. Handy for member-only products or blog posts!

Just make sure your redirect URL is not also locked, or customers will get stuck in a loop.

You can also use JavaScript to add the redirect field dynamically. See the full tutorial for code samples.

Customizing your registration flow is a great way to welcome new members and guide them to your best content. A little extra code can make a big difference!

#### Hiding Search Engine Content <a name="faq-seo"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/more/how-does-locksmith-affect-search-engines-and-seo

Locksmith has a few built-in features to help hide your locked content from search engines:

1. Automatic "noindex" meta tag: This tells search bots not to index locked pages. It's added by default, but you can disable it in the lock settings.

2. Automatic "nofollow" meta tag: Similar to noindex, this tells bots not to follow any links on locked pages. Also added by default and optional.

3. Hide from sitemap: This advanced lock option removes locked products and pages from your Shopify-generated sitemap. Search engines use the sitemap to discover content.

4. Hide from robots: This lock option adds an "unavailable_after" restriction to your pages' robot instructions. This tells bots when to stop showing the page in search results.

All of these work together to keep your locked content out of search indexes. You don't have to do anything extra.

However, they only hide content that is fully locked. If you're using Locksmith's manual locking feature to hide prices or add-to-cart buttons, the rest of the page content may still be indexed.

If you need to lock some parts of a page while still making it discoverable in search, here are a few tips:

- Use descriptive page titles and meta descriptions. These are not affected by Locksmith and help search engines understand your page.
- Provide some unlocked content at the top of the page, like a product photo and short description. This gives search bots something to index.
- Add structured data to your page with product details, ratings, and pricing. Even if the visible price is hidden, structured data helps bots categorize your products.
- Submit your key pages to Google Search Console for faster indexing. This is a good idea for any important page, locked or not.

In general, it's best to lock as little as possible if search traffic is important to your store. Use Locksmith to protect your most exclusive content, but keep your main collections and products open.

You can always funnel search visitors to a locked page after they click through. The initial landing page is what matters most for SEO.

If you're not sure how your locks are affecting your search performance, try temporarily disabling them and watching your search rankings. If you see a big change, you may need to rethink your lock strategy.

Or ask the Locksmith team for advice! They eat, sleep, and breathe this stuff. They're always happy to help you find the right balance of security and visibility.

#### Issues After Switching Themes <a name="faq-theme-switch"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/more/i-switched-themes-and-locksmith-isnt-working

If your Locksmith locks break after changing themes, don't panic! This is a common issue with an easy fix.

Locksmith adds its protection code directly to your theme files. When you switch themes, that code doesn't automatically carry over. 

To fix it:

1. Open the Locksmith app and go to the "Help" page
2. Click the big "Update Locksmith" button
3. Wait a few seconds for the confirmation message

This re-installs Locksmith's scripts and snippets in your new theme. Your locks should start working again right away.

One caveat: If you were using Locksmith's manual locking feature to hide prices or add-to-cart buttons in your old theme, you'll need to re-add those code snippets to your new theme files. The manual snippets are theme-specific.

If you're not sure where to put the manual locking code in your new theme, just ask the Locksmith support team. They'll be happy to take a look and walk you through it.

It's a good idea to test your locks thoroughly after any theme change, just to be safe. Use Locksmith's "Test mode" to preview your protection without affecting real customers.

And if you ever get stuck, the Locksmith team is just a message away. They've seen it all and can usually get you back up and running in a jiffy.

Happy theme switching!

#### Locksmith Not Uninstalling Correctly <a name="faq-uninstall-issues"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/more/locksmith-is-not-uninstalling-correctly

Locksmith is designed to cleanly remove itself from your store when you uninstall the app. But sometimes it needs a little extra help:

1. If you used any manual locking code in your theme files, remove thatcode first. Locksmith can't automatically delete custom code snippets.

2. In the Locksmith app, go to the "Help" page and click "Remove Locksmith"
3. Wait for the confirmation message that Locksmith has been removed from your theme
4. Go to your Shopify admin and click "Delete" on the Locksmith app listing

If you skip step 2 (removing Locksmith from your theme), you may end up with leftover Locksmith snippets in your theme files. These can cause error messages or broken pages.

If that happens, don't worry! Just reinstall the Locksmith app temporarily and repeat the removal steps in order. 

The Locksmith team is also happy to double-check your theme files and clean up any stubborn snippets. Just send them a message with your theme name and they'll take care of it.

Uninstalling apps can be tricky, but Locksmith tries to make it as painless as possible. A little caution and cleanup go a long way!

#### Locksmith Not Installing Correctly <a name="faq-install-issues"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/more/locksmith-isnt-installing-correctly

If you're seeing error messages or missing content after installing Locksmith, a few things to check:

1. Is your theme supported? Locksmith works with most standard Shopify themes, but some custom themes use unconventional file structures that can confuse the auto-installer. Contact the Locksmith team with your theme name and they can take a look.

2. Are your theme files too big? Shopify limits the size of individual theme assets. If you have a lot of Liquid code or JSON data in a single file, Locksmith's scripts may push it over the limit. Try splitting the file into smaller chunks or removing unused code.

3. Did a previous uninstall leave behind snippets? If you uninstalled Locksmith before, there may be leftover code in your theme causing conflicts. Use the "Remove Locksmith" button on the app's Help page to clean those up.

4. Are you using any other security or firewall apps? Some apps block Locksmith's installation requests. Try temporarily disabling other apps and see if that fixes the issue.

If you're still seeing problems, the Locksmith team can do a full audit of your theme and identify the culprit. They've seen all kinds of weird theme setups and can usually spot the issue pretty quickly.

In the meantime, you can use the "Liquid assets to ignore" setting in the Locksmith app preferences to skip specific files during installation. This can help isolate problem areas.

Installation hiccups are frustrating, but don't let them stop you from securing your store! The Locksmith team is always happy to lend a hand. 

#### Customers Re-Entering Email for Newsletter Keys <a name="faq-newsletter-reentry"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/more/my-customers-have-to-enter-their-e-mail-address-into-the-mailchimp-key-every-time-they-visit

If you're using Locksmith's Mailchimp or Klaviyo keys to collect newsletter signups, you may notice repeat customers having to re-enter their email to unlock content.

This is because Locksmith uses the customer's browser cookies to remember their signup. If they clear their cookies or use a different device, Locksmith won't recognize them.

A few ways to smooth out the process:

1. Enable the "Remember for signed-in customers" option on your newsletter key. This saves the signup to the customer's account so they only have to enter their email once.

2. Use a "Signed in" key alongside your newsletter key. This will let registered customers bypass the newsletter prompt entirely.

3. Customize your newsletter prompt to explain that the email is only needed once. Something like "Enter your email to unlock this content. Don't worry, we'll remember you next time!"

4. On your signup thank-you page, encourage customers to create an account to access all your locked content with one login.

Keep in mind that Locksmith won't add duplicate signups to your mailing list. So even if a customer enters their email multiple times, you'll only have one copy in Mailchimp or Klaviyo.

If you're using the newsletter key as a way to grow your list, a little friction isn't necessarily a bad thing. It gives customers a chance to opt in again and reaffirm their interest.

But if you're using the newsletter key more as an access control method, it's worth adding some remember-me functionality to streamline the process.

As always, test your lock flow regularly to spot any hiccups. And if you need help, the Locksmith team is just a message away!

#### Featured Collections Only Showing One Product <a name="faq-featured-collections"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/more/my-featured-collections-on-my-home-page-only-show-one-product

If you're using Locksmith to hide products in a featured collection on your homepage, you may notice the collection only showing a single product.

This is a known issue with some Shopify themes, especially older ones like Minimal. It's caused by a naming conflict between the collection and product variables.

To fix it, you'll need to edit your theme files:

1. In the Shopify admin, go to Online Store > Themes and click "Edit Code" on your current theme
2. Open the "sections/featured-collection.liquid" file
3. Look for a line like this:

{% for product in collections[featured].products limit: total_products %}

4. Change "featured" to "featured_collection":

{% for product in collections[featured_collection].products limit: total_products %}

5. Save and check your homepage

You may need to make this change in a few other places, like line 1 and line 30 of the same file. Just replace any standalone "featured" variables with "featured_collection".

If you're not comfortable editing theme files, no worries! Just send a message to the Locksmith support team with your theme name and they'll walk you through it.

This is one of those quirky Shopify theme issues that pops up from time to time. But with a little code tweak, you'll be back to a full featured collection in no time.

#### Infinite Scroll Not Showing All Products <a name="faq-infinite-scroll"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/more/my-infinite-scrolling-doesnt-show-all-of-my-products

If you're using Locksmith to hide products on a collection page with infinite scroll, you may run into an issue where some products are cut off and never load.

This happens because of how Shopify and Locksmith handle pagination:

1. Shopify loads a set number of products per page, say 50
2. Locksmith hides any of those 50 that the customer doesn't have access to
3. Infinite scroll loads the next page when the customer reaches the bottom
4. But if an entire page is empty (because Locksmith hid all 50 products), infinite scroll thinks it's reached the end and stops loading

So if you have 100 products, 50 are hidden, 50 are visible, but they're split across multiple pages, the customer may only see the first 25.

A few workarounds:

1. Increase the products per page in your theme settings to the max of 50. This makes it less likely to have an empty page in the middle of your collection.

2. Use separate collections for locked and visible products, so you don't have gaps.

3. Customize your infinite scroll code to keep loading until it hits a few empty pages in a row, instead of just one. This requires some JavaScript skills.

4. Disable infinite scroll and use regular pagination instead. Not as smooth, but ensures all products are accessible.

Infinite scroll is tricky with hidden products, but it is possible to make it work with some tweaks. 

The Locksmith team is happy to take a look at your collection setup and suggest the best approach. They've helped many stores optimize their infinite scroll + Locksmith combo.

Just remember, the key is to minimize gaps in your product grid. Whether that means reorganizing your collections, bumping up your products per page, or finding a clever coding workaround, there's always a solution!

#### Passcode Prompt Issues <a name="faq-passcode-prompt"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/more/passcode-prompt-issues

Are your Locksmith passcode prompts not showing the right message? There are a few places to check:

1. The lock's "Passcode prompt" message. This is the main message that appears above the passcode entry field. You can customize it in the lock settings.

2. The passcode key's "Custom input prompt". If you've added a custom prompt to an individual passcode key, it will override the main lock message. Check each key to make sure they're not conflicting.

3. The Locksmith app's "Messages" settings. There are default passcode messages here that will be used if you don't set a custom one on the lock or key.

When in doubt, start with the key-level message. If there's nothing there, move up to the lock-level message. And if that's blank, check the app-wide default.

It's also important to note that passcode prompts are cached in the customer's browser. So if you change a prompt but don't see the new version, try using an incognito window or clearing your cache.

If you're using Locksmith's manual locking feature to show the passcode prompt on a specific part of the page, make sure the "Passcode prompt" message is blank. Otherwise, you'll get duplicate prompts.

And if you're using passcodes in multiple places throughout your store, consider standardizing your prompt text to avoid confusion. A simple "Enter your access code" works well in most cases.

If you're still seeing the wrong prompts after checking all these spots, send a message to the Locksmith team. They can take a look at your lock setup and spot any rogue messages.

Passcode locks are a great way to give customers quick access without requiring a full account. With a little prompt management, you can make the experience smooth and intuitive for everyone!

#### Compatibility with Site Speed Apps <a name="faq-site-speed"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/more/site-speed-apps

Locksmith is not officially compatible with site speed optimization apps like NitroPack or Hyperspeed. These apps work by caching your pages and serving them from a separate content delivery network (CDN).

This can interfere with Locksmith's protection in a few ways:

1. The cached version of your page may not include Locksmith's scripts, so locks don't apply
2. The CDN may serve different versions of the page to different users, bypassing locks
3. The app's minification and combination of files can break Locksmith's code

Some speed apps also use aggressive prefetching and preloading, which can trigger Locksmith's protection prematurely and cause issues.

In general, it's best to disable any speed optimization apps while using Locksmith. They can cause unexpected behavior and make it harder to troubleshoot lock problems.

If you absolutely need to use a speed app, try excluding your locked pages from the optimization process. Most apps have a way to whitelist specific URLs or directories.

You can also use Locksmith's "Liquid assets to ignore" setting to prevent the app from modifying certain theme files. This can help avoid conflicts.

But the safest approach is to optimize your store in other ways, like:

- Choosing a fast, lightweight theme
- Compressing and resizing images
- Minimizing third-party scripts and apps
- Using Shopify's built-in performance features like lazy loading and minification

These techniques can speed up your store without interfering with Locksmith's security.

If you're not sure whether a speed app is compatible with Locksmith, just ask! The Locksmith team keeps up with the latest optimization tools and can advise on the best approach for your store.

In the end, a little extra load time is worth it for the peace of mind that comes with knowing your content is fully protected. Don't let speed apps compromise your Locksmith setup!

#### Thing I Want to Lock Not Showing in Search <a name="faq-search-missing"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/more/the-thing-i-want-to-lock-isnt-showing-up-in-the-locksmith-search

If you're trying to lock a specific page or product in Locksmith but it's not showing up in the search results, a few things to check:

1. Is the spelling correct? Locksmith searches for exact matches, so even a small typo can throw it off.

2. Is it a product variant? Locksmith doesn't search for variants by default. Try searching for the main product title instead, then select the specific variant from the results.

3. Is it a blog post? Locksmith can only lock entire blogs, not individual posts. Try searching for the blog title instead.

4. Is it a collection or page that was recently created? Locksmith's search index may need to be updated. Go to the app's "Help" page and click "Update Locksmith" to refresh the list.

5. Is it in a different language? Locksmith uses your store's default language for search. If you have a multi-language store, switch to the default to find the content.

If you're still not seeing the right results, try using Locksmith's advanced search filters. You can narrow down by content type using these prefixes:

- product:shirt
- collection:summer
- page:about
- blog:news
- variant:large

This tells Locksmith to only look for that specific type of content, which can help surface hard-to-find items.

You can also use Locksmith's "Liquid lock" feature to manually specify the URL or handle of the page you want to lock. This bypasses the search entirely and lets you lock anything with a direct link.

If all else fails, the Locksmith support team is happy to dig through your store and find that elusive lockable content. They've tracked down many a hidden product or rogue collection.

Remember, if it exists in your Online Store, you can lock it with Locksmith! It just might take a little creative searching to track it down.

#### Customers Seeing reCAPTCHA When Logging In <a name="faq-recaptcha"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/more/why-are-my-customers-seeing-a-recaptcha-when-logging-in

If your customers are being prompted to complete a reCAPTCHA challenge when logging in to access locked content, that's actually a Shopify security feature, not Locksmith.

Shopify uses reCAPTCHA on login and contact forms to prevent spam and bot activity. It's automatically enabled for most stores.

While this extra step can be frustrating for legitimate customers, it's an important safeguard against fake accounts and unauthorized access.

If you want to disable reCAPTCHA:

1. In the Shopify admin, go to Online Store > Preferences 
2. Scroll down to the "Spam protection" section
3. Uncheck "Use reCAPTCHA on contact forms" and "Use reCAPTCHA on login forms"
4. Save your changes

Keep in mind that this will remove reCAPTCHA from all your forms, not just the ones used by Locksmith. It's an all-or-nothing setting.

If you're using Locksmith's "Customers must be signed in" key, you may want to leave reCAPTCHA enabled to prevent unauthorized account creation. The extra friction is worth it to keep your member list clean.

But if you're using password-based keys like passcodes or secret links, you can safely disable reCAPTCHA without compromising security. Locksmith's keys provide their own layer of protection.

Ultimately, it's up to you to decide the right balance of security and convenience for your store. If reCAPTCHA is causing more headaches than it's preventing, it may be time to turn it off.

Just remember, Locksmith has no control over Shopify's built-in security features. If you're seeing unexpected prompts or challenges, always check your Shopify settings first.

And if you're not sure how reCAPTCHA fits into your overall access control strategy, the Locksmith team is happy to advise. They've helped many stores strike the perfect balance.

#### Locksmith Adding Info to Orders <a name="faq-order-info"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/more/why-is-locksmith-adding-information-to-my-orders

If you're seeing Locksmith-related notes or tags on your Shopify orders, don't be alarmed! This is normal behavior for certain key types.

When you use keys like passcodes, secret links, or location-based access, Locksmith needs to store that information somewhere to remember the customer's access status. The only place it can do this is in the customer's cart.

So when an order is placed, that Locksmith data gets carried over and appears in the order details. It might look something like this:

Locksmith: { "keyid": 12345, "code": "abc123" }

This is just Locksmith's way of keeping track of which key was used to access the locked content. It doesn't affect the order itself.

However, if you have a lot of keys or a high volume of orders, these notes can start to clutter up your order history. Luckily, there's a way to hide them:

1. In the Locksmith app, go to Settings > General
2. Enable the "Remove Locksmith information from orders" option
3. Click "Update" to save your changes

This tells Locksmith to automatically delete its own notes from the order details after the order is processed. The information is still stored internally, but it won't show up on the customer-facing order page or in your Shopify reports.

If you're using Locksmith with other apps or integrations that rely on order data, you may want to leave this setting disabled. The extra information could be useful for troubleshooting or segmentation.

But for most stores, hiding the Locksmith notes is a easy way to keep your orders tidy and focused on the essential details.

One important note: If you see Locksmith data on orders even after uninstalling the app, don't worry! Those are just old notes from when the app was active. They'll disappear on their own as new orders come in.

If you need to remove Locksmith data from past orders, the app's support team can help. Just send them a message with your shop name and a date range, and they'll clean things up for you.

At the end of the day, a little extra data never hurt anyone. But if you prefer a minimalist approach to order management, Locksmith is happy to stay out of the way!

#### Remote Key Conditions Not Working <a name="faq-remote-keys"></a>
https://www.locksmith.guide/faqs/more/why-isnt-my-remote-key-condition-working

Are your Locksmith passcode, secret link, or location keys not triggering like they should? There are a few common culprits:

1. Browser caching: If you've successfully unlocked the content before, your browser may remember your access and skip the key prompt on future visits. Try using an incognito window or clearing your cache to see the lock screen again.

2. Customer account sign-in: If you're logged into a customer account that has previously unlocked the content, Locksmith will remember that and grant access automatically. Try logging out or using a different account to test the key flow.

3. Expired keys: If you're using a key with a time limit or usage limit, it may have expired since you last tested it. Check the key settings and make sure it hasn't hit its limit.

4. Changed key settings: If you've edited the key settings (like the passcode or IP address) since unlocking the content, you'll need to re-enter the new value to regain access. Locksmith always checks against the current key settings.

5. Incorrect URL: If you're using a secret link key, make sure you're using the exact URL provided by Locksmith. Even a small change (like adding or removing a slash) can break the key.

6. Multiple keys: If you have multiple keys on a single lock, Locksmith will grant access as soon as any one key is satisfied. So if you have a passcode key and a "signed in" key, and you're logged in, you won't see the passcode prompt. Test each key individually to make sure they're all working.

If you've ruled out all these common issues and your keys still aren't working, it's time to do some deeper troubleshooting:

1. Check the Locksmith app for error messages or warnings on the affected locks. These will often point you in the right direction.

2. Use Locksmith's "Test mode" to simulate different access scenarios and see how your keys respond. This is a safe way to experiment without affecting real customers.

3. Temporarily disable all other locks and keys except the one you're testing. This will help isolate the problem and rule out conflicts.

4. If you're using location-based keys, try using a VPN or proxy to test different IP addresses. Sometimes the geolocation data can be inaccurate or out of date.

5. If you're using passcodes or secret links with an input list, make sure the list is properly formatted and up to date. A single typo or extra space can break the whole key.

If you're still stuck, the Locksmith support team is here to help. They can review your lock setup, test your keys, and pinpoint the problem. Just send them a message with as much detail as possible about your issue.

Remote keys are some of the most powerful tools in Locksmith's arsenal, but they can also be the most finicky. A little patience and methodical testing will usually get them back on track.

And remember, even the most well-crafted key is useless if the door is already open! Always test your locks from a fresh, unbiased perspective to make sure they're really doing their job.
