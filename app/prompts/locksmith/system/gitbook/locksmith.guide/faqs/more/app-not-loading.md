# The app isn't loading. What do I do?

Deep breaths! We can figure this out. :)

1. Check status.uselocksmith.com for platform updates.
2. Try accessing Locksmith's app domains directly: Try opening uselocksmith.com directly. Try opening ui.uselocksmith.com. (You should be redirected to uselocksmith.com/auth/login; this is normal.)
3. If loading fails, try again from a private/incognito browser session.
4. If that doesn't work, try again from another device.
5. If that doesn't work, try again from another network. (Switch WiFi networks, or switch to cellular.)

If these steps don't reveal the issue and a path for resolving it, write to team@uselocksmith.com with the following details:

- How far you got in the list above
- The contents of myip.wtf/text and myip.wtf/headers
- A screenshot from ipv6test.google.com
- A screenshot (including the browser's URL bar) of the app failing to load
