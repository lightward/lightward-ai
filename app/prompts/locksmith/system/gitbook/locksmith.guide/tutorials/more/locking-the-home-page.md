# Locking the home page

How to create a lock that covers the home page of your Online Store sales channel in Shopify

## Option 1 - locking your entire store

Locksmith gives you the ability to lock your entire store, which you can select when creating a new lock:

Once the lock for your entire store is created, you'll see an option labelled "Allow access to the home page". It is unchecked by default - leave it that way to ensure that the home page is locked.

## Option 2 - create a lock that ONLY covers the home page

This can be done using a simple custom lock. Choose "Start a Liquid lock" from the list when creating a new lock:

For the "Liquid condition", use template == "index"

Press "Create lock" to finish the lock creation. Make sure to add your keys on the following page like normal.
