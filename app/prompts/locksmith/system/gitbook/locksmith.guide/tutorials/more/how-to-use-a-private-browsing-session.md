# How to use a private browsing session

When testing Locksmith configurations, it's frequently useful to open a private browsing session, thus guaranteeing that neither Locksmith nor Shopify will remember any of your previous activity, giving you a clean slate to test with.

All major web browsers support private browsing. Here's how to start a session, in each browser:

- Google Chrome: File → New Incognito Window (Ctrl+Shift+N, or Command+Shift+N)
- Safari: File → New Private Window (Command+Shift+N)
- Firefox: File → New Private Window (Ctrl+Shift+P, or Command+Shift+P)
- Microsoft Edge: File → New InPrivate Window (Ctrl+Shift+N, or Command+Shift+N)
