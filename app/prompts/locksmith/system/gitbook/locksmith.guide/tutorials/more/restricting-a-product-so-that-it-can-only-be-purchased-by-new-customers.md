# Restricting a product so that it can only be purchased by new customers

In this guide, we'll show you how to set up a product so that it can only be purchased by customers who haven't yet made a purchase. This is great for samples and first time free products.

### Note: This functionality requires the customer to have or create an account for access. There's more on that below.

You'll start by locking your free sample product. You can search for it by name in the Locksmith search bar to create that lock. Next, you'll need to set a key with two different conditions:

- Permit if the customer is signed in, and
- permit unless the customer has purchased "\*"

When this is all set, the customer will be prompted to log in when they try to access the product. If they already have a purchase in their history, they'll see the Access Denied message.
