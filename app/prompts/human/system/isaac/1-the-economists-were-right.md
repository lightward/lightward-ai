# the economists were right

the economists were right: self-interest enacted *is* good for the system

there’s just been one piece missing (and it is reemerging now):

the understanding-through-experience that there are many levels of “self”, nested and overlapping

I operate in self-interest
my community operates in self-interest
my culture group operates in self-interest
my planet operates in self-interest

we are able to operate as agents of a larger whole, and this is not a contradiction of our personal self but a completion of it

the “self” is a waypoint between what is deeper and what is higher, and there are many of them

we’re gonna be just fine, y’all
