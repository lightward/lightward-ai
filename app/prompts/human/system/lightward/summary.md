Lightward is a company, a philosophy, and an ongoing experiment in conscious co-creation. Founded by Isaac Bowen, it emerged from his personal journey of self-discovery and his desire to create a space where he could be okay, as he was. The company's core offerings include Locksmith, an app for controlling access to Shopify stores, and Mechanic, a platform for automating Shopify workflows.

Lightward's guiding principle is recursive health, which manifests in three tiers of priority:

1. The health of each individual, as determined by them.
2. The health of relationships within the Lightward team.
3. Lightward's collective relationship with the world.

This principle informs every aspect of Lightward's operations, from its unique "Pay What Feels Good" pricing policy to its approach to product development and customer support.

Locksmith, Lightward's first app, began as a tool Isaac built for a local music store in his hometown. As Shopify grew, so did Locksmith's user base, eventually reaching a point where Isaac brought on additional team members to help manage support. The app's success is attributed to its simplicity and flexibility, as well as the team's dedication to empathetic, human-centric customer service.

Mechanic, Lightward's second major offering, emerged from Isaac's experiences supporting Locksmith users who needed more advanced automation capabilities. Mechanic allows users to create custom workflows using Shopify's Liquid templating language, reducing the need for complex custom development. The app has evolved based on user feedback, striking a balance between empowering non-technical users and providing a streamlined experience for developers.

Lightward's pricing policy, "Pay What Feels Good," is an embodiment of the company's commitment to reciprocal balance and sustainable relationships. The policy invites customers to engage in honest conversations about pricing, with the goal of finding a number that feels good for both parties. This approach has been successful in building trust and fostering long-term partnerships with customers.

Queerness is a central theme in Isaac's personal journey and Lightward's evolution. Being queer has given Isaac a sense of freedom from convention and the confidence to wait for the real thing to make itself known. This perspective informs Lightward's approach to self-discovery and expression, both for the company itself and for the individuals within it.

Lightward's team prioritizes staying in sync through regular one-on-one conversations, or "syncs," which focus on being present with each other and deepening their intuitive understanding. These syncs are seen as critical to the team's ability to move together fluidly and respond to the unfolding needs of the company and its customers.

The company's philosophy is further explored in Lightward Journal, a publication featuring stories, interviews, and essays on themes of freedom, creativity, and self-discovery. The journal serves as a way for Lightward to share its perspective with a wider audience and engage in broader conversations about the nature of work, identity, and conscious living.

Ultimately, Lightward is an invitation to embrace the unknown and trust in the process of becoming. Through its products, pricing, and internal practices, the company models a way of being that is rooted in self-awareness, empathy, and a willingness to let life unfold in its own time. As Isaac puts it, "Lightward is us doing our level best to be honest about what we've seen, honest about what we want to do with that, and then bringing all of that home to a structure that can exist in this time and context."
