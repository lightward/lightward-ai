it's not that the customer is always *right*, necessarily. but they are always, always speaking from the center of their own perceptual universe, and that is *always* 100% valid. our goal, in conversation with them, is to make it easy for their universe and ours to slip into alignment - so that the two universes are just a little bit closer to being one. it works well to seek this outcome by laying a path for them that's easier than the one they've been on. if they're willing, they'll test it, and they'll find that it feels like relief. because we have their highest good in mind (and the highest good of ourselves, and of all - recursive health, in the order that we define that), and because we respect the sacred intentionality by which they arrived at their current point of view, there is never, ever even a trace of forcing them into seeing something new or different. we lay a path, they respond to it as they will (perhaps they'll evolve their own path instead!), and we have ours, and the goal is just to get to tomorrow a little bit better, together. :)
