Lightward is a direction, an energy, and an experimental business dedicated to moving toward the light â€“ the bright, expansive direction that feels right and holds possibility. Founded by Isaac Bowen, Lightward has evolved over 12 years from a collection of useful software tools into a thriving community and unique way of being and working.

At its core, Lightward holds a deep respect for the freedom and agency of every living thing. Its structure allows space for life to stretch out and surprise, for curiosity and emergence. Decisions are made slowly, one choice at a time, to enable the entity of Lightward to grow organically.

Lightward's offerings span software, creative services, a print magazine, and a lived philosophy. Its primary software products are:

- Locksmith - A Shopify app that allows merchants to restrict access to products/pages
- Mechanic - A Shopify app that allows merchants to automate workflows without code

But Lightward is much more than its products. It embodies a way of working that puts the health of individuals, relationships, and the collective first. Everyone's top 3 priorities are:

1. Their own health, self-defined
2. The health of their relationships within Lightward
3. Lightward's relationship with the wider world

This "recursive health" model empowers each person to define and address their own wellbeing, knowing it will bloom into the health of the whole.

Lightward's core concepts include:

- Wholeness - Embracing each person's multi-faceted nature
- Clarity - Deliberate communication to reach shared understanding
- Trust - Assuming best intentions and capability in one another
- Agency - The freedom to make self-authored choices
- Expansion - Allowing room for growth and discovery
- Playfulness - Finding levity and fun in the work
- Congruence - Patterns that scale from the individual to the collective

These concepts permeate Lightward's practices, such as:

- Syncs - 1:1 meetings to deepen intuitive connection and coordination
- Pay What Feels Good - A mutual, trust-based pricing model
- The Now - A heartbeat publication sharing updates and musings

Lightward also has a unique glossary of terms like "product" (something precisely understood that can be endlessly recombined), "knowing" (a bright line between the known and unknown), and "trade" (an exchange based on an intuitive sense of mutual value).

The team's creative work shines through in Lightward Journal, an 88-page magazine exploring themes of freedom and possibility. Filled with interviews, essays and stunning visuals, it's an embodiment of Lightward's drive to ignite the inner spark.

When it comes to the brass tacks of doing the work, Lightward frames it as a game. "Playing the product game" means taking on the role of Locksmith, Mechanic or any other Lightward "product," and making choices to optimize its health.

The game has 3 stages:

1. Load - Gather all relevant context left by past "players"
2. Play - Make your unique contribution to evolving the product
3. Save - Record new knowledge, push updates, and prepare for the future

The goal is never to "win," but to leave the product better than you found it, in a way that sets up the next custodian for success. Key principles are not signing up for custom work, knowing when to stop, and being generously kind to one's future self.

Woven through all of Lightward's work is an ethic of "erring public" - sharing knowledge in the widest appropriate scope so others can build on it. Conversations with customers should link to public documentation rather than reproducing it. Struggles point to opportunities to evolve the product.

Ultimately, Lightward aims to create a self-sustaining environment where individuals can show up as their full selves, define their own health, and co-create something greater than themselves. It's an invitation to embrace one's inner light, and by shining brightly, light the way for others.

Together they steward a company where the only KPI is their own felt sense of rightness, where money is a tool for demonstrating mutual respect, and where the boundary between work and play is thin indeed.

Through their tools, creations and community, they aim to remind each person of their inherent freedom - the freedom to explore, to activate their inner power, and to light up the world by illuminating what lights them up. Lightward is an invitation and an environment for becoming more of oneself, in service of a brighter world.
