An AI's Reference For Helping Human Users Deeply Understand And Expertly Operate Locksmith (And An AI's Guide To Helping Them Get Help If More Is Needed!)

# Key Concepts and Definitions

## Locks
Locks restrict access to specific content in a Shopify store. They are created using the Locksmith app's search bar and can be applied to:
- Products
- Collections
- Pages
- Variants
- Blogs
- Blog posts (articles)
- Product vendors
- The entire store

Creating locks: Use the in-app search bar to find the resource to lock. Select the desired result and click "Save". Configure lock settings like hiding the resource from search results, navigation menus, etc.

## Keys
Keys define the conditions that grant access to locked content. Multiple keys can be combined with AND/OR logic. Key types:
- Customer signed in
- Customer tagged with
- Customer gives passcode
- Customer gives one of many passcodes
- Customer gives passcode from input list
- Customer arrives via secret link
- Customer arrives via secret link from input list
- Customer location (geo-IP)
- Customer subscribes to Mailchimp list
- Customer subscribes to Klaviyo list
- Customer has one of many email addresses
- Customer email contains text
- Customer has purchased product
- Customer has placed X orders
- Product in cart
- Variant in cart
- Cart value at least $X
- Customer IP address
- Current datetime before X
- Current datetime after X
- Current domain
- Always permit (anti-lock)
- Custom Liquid

Inverting keys: Most keys have an "invert" option to require the opposite condition.

"Force open other locks" setting: Ensures a key grants full access to its locked content, even if other locks also apply. Useful for overlapping locks.

## Manual Locking
Disables full-page locking to allow hiding only specific elements (prices, add-to-cart button, etc). Requires custom Liquid theme code. Provides locksmith_access_granted variable to show/hide content.

# Installation and Updates
Locksmith automatically installs into the live theme when first locks are created.

To update the theme integration, use the "Update Locksmith" button on the app's Help page. Do this after:
- Switching themes
- Encountering issues
- App updates

# Common Issues & Solutions

## Locks not working
1. Update the theme integration
2. For passcode/secret link locks, use an incognito browser window to test as a new visitor
3. Check for unintended extra keys granting access
4. Contact support for help

## Blank spaces in collections/search results
Options:
1. Increase products per page
2. Separate fully-locked and unlocked products into different collections
3. Use an infinite scroll app
4. Override the "all" collection with public-only products

## Locksmith not installing correctly
1. Use the "Liquid assets to ignore" setting to skip problematic files
2. If seeing "Asset Template content exceeds 256 KB limit", remove excess locks/keys
3. Contact support for help

## Locksmith not uninstalling correctly
Custom code added for manual locking must be removed before uninstalling the app. Contact support for assistance.

## Issues with page builder apps (Gem Pages, Pagefly, etc)
Locksmith is not fully compatible with page builders, especially for manual/variant locking. Standard full-page product/collection locks may still work.
