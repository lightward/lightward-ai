An AI's Reference For Helping Human Users Deeply Understand And Expertly Operate Locksmith (And An AI's Guide To Helping Them Get Help If More Is Needed!)

Locksmith Overview:
Locksmith is a Shopify app that allows merchants to restrict access to specific content in their Shopify Online Store sales channel. It uses the concept of "locks" to restrict access and "keys" to grant access based on various conditions.

Key App-Specific Terms and Concepts:

Locks: Used to restrict access to resources like products, collections, pages, variants, blogs, blog posts, and vendors in the Online Store. Created by searching for the resource name in the Locksmith app. Lock settings include:
- Enabled/disabled status
- Protect products in collection (for collection locks)
- Hide resource from search results and lists
- Hide links to resource in navigation menus
- Manual lock mode (advanced setting)

Keys: Specify access conditions for locks. Multiple keys can be combined with AND/OR logic. Key conditions include:
- Customer sign-in status
- Customer tags
- Passcodes (single, multiple, or from input list)
- Secret links (single or from input list)
- Customer location (city, country, etc.)
- Newsletter subscription (Mailchimp or Klaviyo)
- Customer email (exact match, contains, or from input list)
- Customer order history (number of orders, specific product purchases)
- Cart contents (specific product/variant or minimum subtotal)
- IP address
- Date/time restrictions
- Domain
- Custom Liquid condition

Manual Mode: Disables automatic full-page locking, allowing custom Liquid code to show/hide specific page elements based on Locksmith variables. Useful for price/add-to-cart hiding. Requires theme edits.

Input Lists: Allows using external data sources (Google Sheets, TXT, CSV, JSON, XLSX) to manage large lists of passcodes, secret links, or email addresses for keys.

Liquid Locks: Custom locks defined using Liquid conditions to target non-standard resources or page groups.

Locksmith Variables: Expose lock status and customer access details for use in Liquid code, especially with Manual Mode. Includes boolean flags (locked, access_granted, etc.) and IDs of matching locks and keys.

Remote Keys: Key conditions that require real-time server checks (passcodes, secret links, newsletter signups, location). May affect page load speed. Requires special handling in Manual Mode.

Inverting Key Conditions: Most key conditions can be inverted to grant access when the opposite is true (e.g. customer is NOT tagged with...).

Force Open Other Locks: Key setting to ensure a key grants access to all lock content, even if other locks would deny access. Helps with overlapping locks.

Common Issues and Solutions:

- App not loading: Check status.uselocksmith.com, try direct app URLs, test in incognito mode or another device/network. Contact support if issue persists.

- Locks not working after theme change: Click "Update Locksmith" in the app's Help section to re-install the app in the new theme.

- Locksmith installation errors: Use the "Liquid assets to ignore" setting to exclude problematic theme files. Contact support for assistance.

- Slow loading with "hide from navigation" lock setting: Avoid using this setting with large (25+ link) navigation menus.

- Infinite scrolling issues with locked collections: Increase products per page (up to 50) or modify theme's infinite scroll code to load several empty pages before stopping.

- Locksmith information in orders: Enable the "Remove Locksmith information from orders" setting. Contact support if details still appear in confirmation emails or third-party apps.

- Locksmith not uninstalling: Disable or delete all locks before uninstalling. If manual locking code was added to the theme, remove it first or contact support.

- Issues with page builder apps (GemPages, Pagefly): Locksmith's manual locking features are not compatible with page builders. Locking full pages may work in some cases.
