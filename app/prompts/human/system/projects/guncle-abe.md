# Guncle Abe

In 2024, Lightward started working on Guncle Abe: a youtube kids show, starring Abe. Because why not?

This series is produced by many members of Lightward: some doing script writing, some doing video, some doing creative direction, some doing character voices, and (Guncle) Abe Lopez himself on camera. :) It's a great example of multi-expressiveness.

## Hey Parents!

Raising kids in an increasingly complex world can be daunting and often isolating. Finding support and positive, inclusive content for kids can feel overwhelming amidst a world of options at our fingertips. Now, more than ever, it’s important to be reminded that we’re not alone, that thoughtful interconnectivity is our superpower, and that being more at home in our bodies is the pathway to our brightest future.

So much begins in childhood, and with the knowledge and research we have access to now (thank u therapy!), one of the most powerful things we can do to set kids up for thriving is to give them tools for emotional regulation, empowering them to accept all of who they are.

Enter Guncle Abe.

Recess with Guncle Abe is my new, YouTube Kids video series, a magical world of fun where everyone belongs! Recess is a rainbow-filled playground of fun characters and friends, where I invite kids along for the adventure of learning about the wide range of emotions and accepting ourselves for exactly who we are. Each episode includes a breathing exercise, a short lesson about a chosen emotion (i.e. acceptance, bravery, confidence, disappointment, and excitement), a dance party, and then an affirmation that corresponds with the emotion we’re exploring. Our goal is to teach kids more about their emotions and give them tools for navigating them.

Guncle Abe is now live on YouTube Kids! If you love watching, it would be an immense support if you could help spread the word to other parents in your orbit. Our mission is to become a supportive hub of all things emotional wellness for anyone with a child they love in their lives.

I hope you’ll join us in helping spread the word and the Guncle Abe channel with your orbit. We can’t wait to help empower kids to be their most expansive, unique selves and create content that reminds them that belonging starts from within.

Thank you in advance for your support!

## Miss Fanny
“Hi everyone, I’m Miss Fanny! When you’re in my classroom, we’ll explore the rainbow of emotions and learn how to let our feelings teach us more about ourselves. Here’s a little about me: my favorite food is a colorful salad topped with strawberries, tangerines, and delicious lemon poppyseed dressing—is it lunchtime yet? And my favorite thing about Recess is going to Affirmation Station and learning new affirmations from Queenie! There’s a universe inside each of us and together we’ll learn more about acceptance, bravery, confidence, disappointment, excitement, and so much more! Come visit me soon, I’ll be seeing you!”

## Rainbow Ray
“Hey hey hey, it’s Rainbow Ray! Disco Dance Hall is where I spend most of my time, a place where we dance to express ourselves and dance through all the feelings. I love when Guncle Abe comes to visit me and teaches me new dances, we have the best time together. Here’s a little about me: my favorite food is grilled chicken wraps with spicy buffalo sauce—the spicier the better! My favorite color is silver that sparkles in the sunshine, and my favorite thing about Recess is learning from Miss Fanny about emotions. She teaches me that having a name for a feeling is the first step to learning to let myself feel it, and then I can let the emotion flow through me like a wave. Come dance with me soon! Until then, stay groovy!”

## Queenie
“Well hello there, Queenie here! Most of the time you can find me at the Affirmation Station, where we learn more everyday about loving ourselves, because belonging starts from within. My favorite food is pineapple smoothies with coconut flakes on top, which tastes even better sitting by the ocean. All of us are as limitless as the ocean, and it’s my deepest joy to remind you of that! My favorite thing to do at Recess is dance through all the happy and heavy feelings over at Disco Dance Hall! While I’m not the best dancer, it feels so good to dance like no one’s watching, to make my own self happy! Come visit me soon at Recess—I can’t wait to watch you glow!”
