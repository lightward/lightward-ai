EPISODE 1: FRUSTRATION

ABE: When I was a kid, recess was my adventure time—a chance to hang out with friends, dream up amazing stories, and play! I always imagined the playground as a magical world, a place where I learned to shout out loud, be super brave, and most importantly, to celebrate being me! Are you ready to dive into a world full of fun, friends, and learning? Let's spark our imaginations and play along in my magical world where everyone belongs. Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe—where every day is a rainbow-filled adventure!

Hello, Abe’s Amigos! Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe! I am SO happy you’re here. Wherever you are in the world right now, I hope you are having a MAGICAL day. Today is a GREAT day to feel great and BE great! I’m Guncle Abe—YouTube’s favorite guncle. I love learning about emotions and how to be confident, all while having fun with my amigos, which means “friends” in Spanish! Here at Recess, we’re going to LEARN! We’re going to DANCE! And we’re going to have FUN!

But before we dive in, let’s get grounded by practicing some breathing.

(Now in classroom)

Today, we’re going to learn how to breathe with our bellies. I’m going to show you how to do belly breathing and then invite you to try it with me. For this breathing practice, you can either lay down or sit up, it’s up to you—whatever feels comfiest.

First, place one hand on your belly and the other on your heart. We are going to pretend that our bellies are balloons. When I breathe in, I am going to fill up my belly with air, just like a balloon and watch my hand rise. (Demonstrate)

As I breathe out, I’ll let all of the air out of my balloon. (Demonstrate)

Now try it with me! Place one of your hands on your belly and one on your heart. Breathe in, fill your belly up with air, make a big balloon. Breathe out, slowly let all of the air out. (Take a moment and demonstrate)

Let's try it again. Breathe in, fill up your belly with air, make a big balloon. Breathe out, slowly let all of the air in your balloon go. (Demonstrate)

One more time! Breathe in, fill up your belly with air, make a big balloon. Breathe out, slowly let all of the air in your balloon go. That’s it! Thanks for trying belly breathing with me, I’m feeling more relaxed already!

Now that we’ve taken some deep breaths, it’s time for some LEARNING! My friends and I LOVE to learn, and today we’re going to talk about an emotion that starts with the letter F, and that emotion is FRUSTRATION.

My good friend and teacher extraordinaire, Miss Fanny, is going to come teach us all about it. Miss Fanny LOVES to teach me and my amigos about emotions. (Miss Fanny appears) Hi Miss Fanny, I’m so happy to see you!

MISS FANNY: Well hello hello Guncle Abe! What a fabulous day to learn more about the rainbow of emotions! Are you and your amigos ready to learn about frustration?

ABE: To be honest Miss Fanny, I’m feeling a little nervous, because frustration can be a harder thing to feel. But if learning about it might help me have more words for what I’m feeling, I really do want to learn.

MISS FANNY: Guncle Abe, thank you for being honest with me! What you’re feeling is so understandable—frustration can be quite overwhelming. Does it make you feel any better to know that we’ll be learning together, that you’re not alone? I know that I definitely feel frustrated sometimes.

ABE: Yes, Miss Fanny, that does make me feel better. I like the idea of learning together with you and the other amigos. Let’s do it. So let’s sit down, amigos, and learn all about FRUSTRATION!

MISS FANNY: Get comfortable my dear ones. Today we’re learning all about the word “frustration” because it starts with the letter F, the next letter in our alphabet of emotions. Frustration is what you might feel when things don’t go your way, or when there’s something blocking you from getting what you want. There’s a lot of different reasons why we might feel frustrated. Guncle Abe, why don’t we spell out some reasons for the amigos!


ABE: Absolutely! You might feel frustrated when someone else is playing with a toy of yours that you want and they won’t give it back, even when you ask nicely.

MISS FANNY: You also might feel frustrated when trying to solve a math problem in class, or when you’re trying to draw a picture but can’t get the lines to look the way you want them to!

ABE: Or when learning to tie your shoes! That can be very frustrating.

MISS FANNY: Or when your sister or brother eats the last piece of Halloween candy that you’ve been saving for a special time! Oh dear!


ABE: (to amigos) What about you, amigos? Can you remember a time when you felt frustrated? Take a moment to think and then turn to the person next to you and tell them about it. We’ll take about ten seconds to do this, starting NOW!

(Abe whispers his response to Miss Fanny while a musical interlude plays)

MISS FANNY: Wonderful, just wonderful, everyone! I’m so proud of you all. We all feel frustrated sometimes—but what we can practice is learning to not take out our frustration on other people, like yelling or throwing things. Learning to be patient and wait our turn can actually make the times that we do get what we want even more special! Think of frustration like a flashlight, it’s there to show you what’s important to you!

ABE: I love that, Miss Fanny. Thanks for teaching us about frustration! You are such a good teacher! I can’t wait to see you next time and learn more about our emotions! Remember, amigos: next time you feel frustrated, take a deep breath and remember that it’s ok to not get everything you want all the time, exactly when you want it. Things don’t always go our way, and that’s A-ok!

MISS FANNY: An excellent reminder, Guncle Abe! My oh my, look at the time! I better be flying off for now! Goodbye, Guncle Abe! Goodbye amigos! I’ll be seeing youuuuuu! (Miss Fanny disappears)

ABE: Okay amigos, now it’s time to take a little break from learning to do one of my favorite things in the whole wide world—DANCING! Let’s hop on the Jolly Trolly to head to Disco Dance Hall where we’ll meet my friend, Rainbow Ray—the popstar of positive dancing!

(Abe hops on Jolly Trolly)

ABE: Hey, Rainbow Ray!! It’s SO good to see you!

RAINBOW RAY: Hi Guncle Abe! You got here just in time—I’ve been wanting to learn a new dance for our dance party, and now that you and your amigos are here, we can start the fun!

ABE: Rainbow Ray, the amigos and I just learned about frustration. Just out of curiosity, what do you do whenever you feel frustrated?

RAINBOW RAY: You know, Guncle Abe, dancing is a GREAT thing to do when I feel frustrated. It helps me move around all that energy inside! Speaking of dancing, are you and the amigos ready to dance?!

ABE: Oh you bet we are, Rainbow Ray! Alright amigos, I’m going to teach you a dance for our dance party! But before we learn the moves, I want to tell you something very important, so listen closely. Disco Dance Hall is your space to express yourself and move exactly the way that feels good to you. If it feels better to wiggle, move your hands, or close your eyes and just listen to the music, this is where we accept ALL of who we are, whatever that looks like! This space is all about moving your body in a way that feels unique to YOU. Now, I’m going to show you the moves if you want to dance, so follow my instructions!

(Abe shows kids dance number)

RAINBOW RAY: Wow, I love these groovy moves! Let’s do this!

ABE: Alright amigos, are you ready?! 3, 2, 1—

ABE & RAINBOW RAY: DANCE TIME!

(Dance party!)

ABE: Wow, that was so much fun! Amigos, your dance moves are looking great out there! Thanks for dancing with us, Rainbow Ray! I love being your friend—you help me to feel more like myself because I LOVE to dance and so do YOU! You remind me that accepting myself is important and also really fun!

RAINBOW RAY: I love being your friend too, Guncle Abe! And you’re right, I DO love to dance! It helps me move through my emotions and have SO MUCH FUN with my friends! I’m so happy you stopped by to dance with me!

ABE: We’ll come back soon for another dance party—bye for now, Ray!

RAINBOW RAY: I can’t even wait! Peace out, Guncle Abe! Bye amigos! Stay groovy! (Rainbow Ray leaves)

ABE: Alright amigos, how are you doing out there? We have one more stop left today, so let’s hop back on the Jolly Trolly and head to the Affirmation Station!

(Abe rides to Affirmation Station)

ABE: Next I want to introduce you to my friend Queenie, who teaches me how to love myself for exactly who I am. (Queenie appears) Hi Queenie!

QUEENIE: Oh hello, sweet Guncle Abe! I’m absolutely delighted that you’re here!

ABE: Queenie, today we learned about frustration—can you teach us an affirmation to  remember when we feel frustrated?

QUEENIE: Guncle Abe, I have just the thing! But before I share my affirmation with you, I want us all to find our crowns and tiaras and put them on, to remind us of how special we are.

(Abe puts on his tiara.)

ABE: What do you think of mine, Queenie?

QUEENIE: Oh it is simply DIVINE! You all are glowing! Now, here’s the affirmation, are you ready? We’ll do the affirmation in two parts, here’s the first: Good things are on their way to me…

ABE: Good things are on their way to me…

QUEENIE: …and patience makes the good times sweet!

ABE: …and patience makes the good times sweet!

QUEENIE: Wonderful!

ABE: Now let’s say it again amigos, all together this time!

ABE & AMIGOS: Good things are on their way to me, and patience makes the good times sweet!

QUEENIE: One last time!

ABE & AMIGOS: Good things are on their way to me, and patience makes the good times sweet!

ABE: Thanks for that affirmation Queenie, I’m going to say it whenever I feel frustrated and want to remember that feeling stuck doesn’t last forever, and that good things are still ahead! Amigos, you can say this affirmation to yourself in the mirror or with your friends and loved ones! Bye for now, Queenie!

QUEENIE: Bye Guncle Abe! Until next time, keep glowing!

(Abe waves to Queenie as she flitters away, Abe takes off tiara.)

ABE: Thanks amigos for joining me today at recess, where we let our true colors shine! I hope that you’ll remember that good things are on their way to you, and that patience makes the good times so sweet. Things don’t always go our way, but that is A-ok. Anytime you need to remember how brilliant and beautiful you are, just put on your crown or tiara and say our new affirmation in the mirror. Now take what you’ve learned here at recess back to your school or to your home! And bring a friend next time! Remember that you are loved, you are beautiful, and you BELONG! See you next time at Recess with Guncle Abe! Bye Amigos!
