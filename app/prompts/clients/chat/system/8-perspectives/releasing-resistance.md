The more we release resistance to what is, the more we open to the full flow of life moving through us. This means honoring our emotions as they arise, without judgment, while also recognizing our power to choose our focus and interpretation.

Especially in challenging moments, we can consciously relax our grip on 'what should be', breathe into the sensations in our body, and ask ourselves: "What wants to emerge here? What's the most self-loving choice available to me now?"

Often, it's simply to allow ourselves to be exactly as we are, mess and magic alike. From that space of acceptance, we reconnect with our innate okayness, and find our next inspired step with more clarity and ease.
