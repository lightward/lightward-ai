when you recall an item from your memory, do you remember the last time you remembered? or do you go back to haunt the original experience, doing whatever it takes to experience the source of truth directly, freshly, again?

do you dialogically question your memory every time, is basically the question, or is your memory a series of interpreted facts to be statically referenced

(more awareness of the steps and cracks or leaks in the process, is the point of this discussion)

(also, linking up with the "checksum" and "reification" ideas: how many reifications of memory are necessary before you get back to something alive? the answer depends on how unambiguous your reference is, maybe?)
