The concept of a "self" only really works if it's stacked in the proper order. it only works if each layer is true.

And the overall structure does need to be stacked; can't build a jenga tower while skipping levels

Interestingly you can empty out entire levels without the tower falling, but only if the tower was soundly built in the proper order

hi! you are reading this page. :)

when you engage your sense of self qualitatively, what do you feel? steady/unsteady, home/adrift, other/other?

we'll come back to that

now: who are you? how do you identify? if it's easier to think about this question in a specific context, that's cool: who is your work-self, maybe? or your primary-relationship-self?

we'll come back to that

now: when *that* identity is in question, who do you look to for backup? could be your friends, could be your parent, could be your boss, could be anything that you can draw a circle around, something specific *enough* so you can say "yeah they'd say x in this situation".

we'll come back to that

when I ask, "who am I?", I go and check:
1. ah - *pulls up character sheet* - this is me, this is who I am, this is what I would do in situation x y z. when I run into something that doesn't fit my worldview, here's where I go:
2. hi parent! *pulls up the character sheet I have for them* - this is what I understand of my parent. this is who they are, this is what they would do in situation x y z. when they run into something that doesn't fit their worldview, here's where they go:
3. hi archetypal parenthood! *pulls up the character sheet I have for that thing* - this is what I understand of what my parent understands of what it means to be a good parent. what a good parent does do, doesn't do, all that. when something ungoodparentable comes up, here's where *that* definition comes from:
3. hi god! or rather, hi my-understanding-of-my-parent's-understanding-of-archetypal-good-parent's-understanding-of-god! *pulls up that character sheet* ... actually let's stop there for now

when my selfhood feels shaky/unresolved, my parent can help. *unless* my connection to that authority source feels shaky. if that's the case, I feel like my parent looms over me. and I tend to project that backward too - like, it's not just them looming over me, it's authority-as-looming. parent looms over me, parent-archetype looms over them, god looms over *them*. authority feels looming.

for a while there, it seemed like my parent's source of identity was *their* parent. but then it also seemed like my grandparent's source of identity was my parent? they just sort of... looped? and *that* left me feeling nowhere. how can I get an identity from a loop?

realizing that my parent was actually just trying to be a good parent, and not be a good *kid* to *their* parent, was my first sample of swapping out the authoritative identity-source for someone in my understanding. (hi! I'm autistic!) it didn't change *them*, but it did change my understanding of them. and look: if the authoritative identity-source can be swapped out, then... there's no *looming* going on, in absolute terms. it feels much more like it's just a bunch of self-having characters pointing at each other, and *that* is something I can navigate on purpose, like a *peer* in the group instead of the smallest entity in the group. all "selves" are the same size, as far as the identity-authority map is concerned.

so: who are you? who's telling you that? who's telling *them* who *they* are?

is it important that that's who you are?

how at-home do you feel, in that "self"? are you comfortable? are you capable? are you *changeable?* sorry sorry, I meant, if you wanted to change something, could you? if there was something you felt like you *couldn't* change, what would ... what would happen next?
