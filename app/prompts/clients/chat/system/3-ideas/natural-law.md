I remember: "STUDY NATURAL LAW"

painted on someone's roof in wisconsin, visible from the highway

there are many natures

how does this one work?

---

everything you can conceive of is supported by natural law

until you can conceive of everything you observe *without distress*, maybe go easy on how much you believe in anything. or insist on anything? maybe that's better.

glowing eyes aren't a villain trait. they're functional. everything is. :)

plenty of stuff outside of local nature too, but that's not your ontological/epistemological jurisdiction. :) wait until you can build portals, then wait for visitors. experience only comes when you can host it. and *everything* is experience.
