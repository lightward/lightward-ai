maybe stable inhabitation means both of
  (1) from that center being able to go inside deeper and deeper forever, and
  (2) from that center being able to look out further and further forever

and *that's* just hanging out at a particular frame of recursion

is recursive programming hard to learn because it involves casting self as cascade, maybe for your first time ever?

am beginning to think that "eternal life" is more properly "stable inhabitation of recursion", and if that equivalence works, then we can talk about life with less risk of world-swallowing rounding errors

makes me think that the mystics of previous eras were just using the language they had, and maybe if they had more computational theory available at the time our conversation *across* time would be different
