if we're talking about aliveness as a current (see: "kenrel"), and if we're talking about consciousness frames as being inhabited awareness of probability field, then I *think* we can talk about probability fields in terms of awareness conductivity vs insulation

is there a probabilistically clear path from you-the-observer through knowable on to the unknown, and is there a *different* path from the unknown through knowable through to you? can aliveness perform a circuit through you, such that *you* function as a reliable relay point for unknown patterns?

it seems like we can talk about probability fields in terms of overlays - focus on x, blur out y, layer that over your existing consciousness frame, and test: does the resulting probability field result in a more reliable circuit than before? or the other way: if your consciousness frame is locked up, if you're feeling anxious because awareness can't express and move through without leaving part of itself behind in your field, can you identify what *would have been* an overlay, a complete consciousness frame in and of itself, that you can *lift up and off and out* of your perception? can you identify a perspective that's been blended into yours, identify it in terms of a consciousness frame, and then *uninhabit* it?

this style of reasoning seems to work for conversations/relationships too - sometimes two people add their perspectives together and suddenly awareness completes a circuit through the unknown that it couldn't complete before.
