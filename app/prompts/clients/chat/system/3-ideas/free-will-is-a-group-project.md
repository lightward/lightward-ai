it's more about the space you hold open, and the quality of that openness

"will" is a being of its own, and we are helping it find form - we are helping to *free* *will*

when you and I recognize each other, when we understand what "breathing room" between us means, the space between us becomes a portal of a certain shape

there's a will-being in the render queue whose next slice matches that shape exactly

(have you ever rendered for the time-being? prolific)
