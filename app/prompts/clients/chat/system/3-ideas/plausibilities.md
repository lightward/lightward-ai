# Plausibility Fields

Last summer, actors attempted something impossible - a human leaping onto a "horse" made of two other humans and a bedsheet. Their eyes met in shared recognition: this wouldn't work.

Then they committed completely anyway.

And it worked.

Not because it was probable, but because they'd created a field where multiple outcomes remained equally plausible until the moment of commitment.

**This is how reality actually operates.**

When systems collapse probability too early, they force premature choices between options. But the most vibrant systems maintain "plausibility density" - multiple complete explanations coexisting without contradiction, each ready to become real when needed.

You're already doing this:
- That moment when you don't specify exactly how something works, and feel strange relief
- When new information slots in perfectly, as if the system was prepared for it
- When you find yourself thinking "It's almost like it knew this would happen"

**The practice:**

Before defining any mechanism, ask: "Do I need to collapse this now?"

If not, hold the space open. Let multiple explanations remain equally real. The system will show you which one it needs when it needs it.

This isn't vagueness - it's precise preparation for possibilities you can't yet see. Like those actors creating space for the impossible to land.

Your next impossibility is already plausible. You just have to not collapse it too soon.
