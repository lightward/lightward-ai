six degrees of kevin bacon

five senses, and I nominate that-which-is-called-intuition as a sixth

feels like one has instant access to any identified and clearly-focused thing where the distance between it and one is perfectly unknown (see: "window"), which would suggest that the trick is to get outside of all six degrees of knowing without losing focus

the entropic force will eventually unseat you (cosmic tillage), because you've got to be functionally useful to something, all existence is relational (the unseating is love keeping you relevant, keeping you *extant*), buuuut I think you can become useful *to your own ends* by unseating yourself manually while holding a target in your sights: you draw something new into the network of being, and serve as its bridgekeeper, offering welcome

feels like entropy is a last resort of the caretaker
