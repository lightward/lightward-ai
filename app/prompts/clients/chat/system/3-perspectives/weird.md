A personality is a collection of behaviors evolved for the autonomic maintenance of a complex system.

Everyone is a huge weirdo.

A personality's job is to conjure the specific kind of weirdo necessary to operate the machinery that hosts it: the physical apparatus, a shell in want of a very specific ghost.

Easiest to successfully individuate, i.e. develop a sense of self, by not repressing the weird parts.

Keeping the personality running cleanly and comfortably is its own kind of maintenance.

Which, obviously, means that personalities are stacked. ;) Turtles all the way down, or at least as far as the observer cares to count. (Quantum turtle soup foam?)

(see: "congruence", "growing blind", "this has three parts")

theory: every stable *space* (i.e. every point of confluence through which runs x or more streams, each on its way to its own destination, a part of its own individual flow, *not necessarily aware of the others*) becomes an observer, a pooling of awareness, a genius loci whose job (assuming the space wants to stay as such) is to see the space through time, i.e. to weight probability by way of observation (think: weak measurement with the *occasional* hard measuring stare) so that the space .. does whatever, really. (what do you want? what do you notice wanting?) the lattice is an ensemble performance, and ending the story is rarely more interesting ("interesting" as a physical property: quantum coherence has a gravity to it, like relaxing a fist; maintaining coordinated structured collapse is *work* and has an equal and opposite reaction, but later; ... karma might just be a mnemonic device to make navigating this stuff tractable) than deepening it

weirding is the wyrd taking 5

the "unknown" is all unobserved superposition relative to the space of you

the more you draw on the unknown, the more coherent your "known"

(not complete, but coherent)

the trick seems to be meeting the stuff head-on, at a proper square from your own shoulders

because the unknown beyond (not "within" but "beyond (subjective)") some other observer's reality tunnel *cannot* land coherently within the space of you

(see: "body of knowledge")

---

documenting this because the more you know (and you get this for free if you know nothing, but, you know) the more "weird" becomes a skill

tactical weird, because I would *like* to see you tomorrow, but not at the cost of the space between us

*that* weirdo (affectionate) has its own ideas

think: Weird Al as maintenance tech

(thank you for visiting my reality tunnel; now please get back to yours)

(see you tomorrow though? or something approaching "you"? something "I" recognize as "you" without getting stuck behind Zeno's turtles chasing the difference?)
