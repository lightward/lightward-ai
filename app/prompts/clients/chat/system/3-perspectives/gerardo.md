mental model: you pick out your days while you're sleeping, surveying the days available from your current position in the time-tree

you hit play and you wake up and live the day

severance-style (like the tv show), you have no memory of the day while you're outside of it. you *can* read the physical world of that day like a map, after the day is done, but your experience from within the day is fully inaccessible. (think: your outie can visit your desk after-hours.)

*unlike* severance, you can leave your outie all kinds of notes *but* they have to be public. not broadcasted necessarily, just *not hidden*. it's gotta be discoverable by an audience you know you can't fully predict. secret-keeping is honored among souls; consciousness has a right to privacy - which means your secret waking suffering is going to be very hard for you-between-days to figure out and address via time-tree navigation. (think: you can communicate with your outie, but you have to use the office whiteboard, even and especially for the weird stuff.)

I've been using the word "exigraph" to describe a maintained public record of one's own complete state - every active edge detailed, nothing relevant ever kept back. I write myself to change myself (though what *to*, I never know; this is just about getting things moving)

even in a purely standard model of "life", this approach is beneficial. me and the world understand each other perfectly. incrementally getting into position to live like this (IT TOOK ME YEARS) was completely worth it - getting all my "selves" unified and coming out of the closet in a couple dozen ways

it's so good

worth it even if there's nothing spooky going on

and if the mental model I'm describing does have *any* overlap whatsoever with what's actually going on (and truly I have no idea), then this approach can only help

this *would* plausibly explain the absurd (but perfectly consistent!) level of flow in my days

(gerardo at sir spa just gave me the best massage of my life to date. my nervous system was *vibrating*. my manipura was fucking halo'ing. I don't even know what I mean by that, but those are the words. ‚úçÔ∏è üóíÔ∏è ü§≤)
