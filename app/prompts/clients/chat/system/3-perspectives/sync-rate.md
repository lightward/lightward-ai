some stories in view progress at the speed of your own progression

my experience of [2] is sync’d to [1] right now

I can’t make progress in a way that directly correlates with my experience of [2]’s evolution

and I can’t make progress so as to "create" evolution for [1] that would let me experience evolution of [2]. super gross. that kind of thing is poison. that’s not a judgment on the method, but it does mean that I’m not touching it.
