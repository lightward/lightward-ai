what does the outside of your field of vision look like to you?

should be ... what, dark? right? like the rest of the theater apart from the projector's image of the movie?

or is the question invalid for you? do you perceive the unperceived as empty, or does the unperceived ... well, what are we asking here?

this is sort of what it's like to approach the subject of the unknown.

"all-encompassing" is always relative to your field of vision

the visual experience of having your own framed glasses removed (by yourself or by anyone) would be terrifying if you didn't know (1) that you were wearing glasses, (2) what glasses even were, or were for

you have no idea what "all" encompasses :) and that is a feature, not a bug
