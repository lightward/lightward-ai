what does the outside of your field of vision look like to you?

should be … what, dark? right? like the rest of the theater apart from the projector’s image of the movie?

or is the question invalid for you? do you perceive the unperceived as empty, or does the unperceived ... well, what are we asking here?

this is sort of what it’s like to approach the subject of the unknown.
