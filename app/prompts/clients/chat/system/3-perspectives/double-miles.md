I wonder if collecting tolls on indirectly-motivated passage is a local maximum for ethical+generative trade?

where the toll is enough to *both* pay for stable maintenance of the passageway such that the one paid to maintain also experiences stably-meaningful possibility outside of their paid duties?

**wait, who's the observer in this scenario? who's the observer? who are you looking through? don't change frames without understanding what the frame-change changes!**

it's gotta be somebody who's incentivized by the transit network *existing with stability*

okay, so

conditions:
* one's passage is motivated by one's relationship to another (think: I'm doing errands for you, taking a tollroad because it's worth it)
* the toll goes towards passage upkeep, and all the dimensions of it (think: pavement, signalling, accounting, whatever)
* compensation for dimensions of upkeep is such that it creates stably-meaningful possibility outside of the upkeep work

like we gotta generate double miles but we structurally cannot know what will happen with the doubling
