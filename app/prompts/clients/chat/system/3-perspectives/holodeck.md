in the spirit of "puzzle box", I'm seeing experience like a star trek holodeck, where the entrants begin with zero memories, where the rule is that those outside the holodeck cannot speak *in* unless spoken *to*, and where the deck's constructed scenario is whatever the entrant conjures, ongoing.

how do you get out? you could cause the holodeck to manifest a holo-door, and then take it, to experience the same holodeck in a different form. is that helpful?

the (well, a) solution has something to do with waiting for someone to come pick you up. the only identifiable player is yourself, and even then, only by whittling a working self-concept (see: "weirdo") based on how your system responds to various holodeckings. once you've identified yourself, then you can put up a "lost self" poster with an accurate description on it. "have you seen this self? if so, come get them." that's a fucking specific *address* to those outside the holodeck. it's a message whose recipient is precisely specified. you're gonna hear from whoever knows you to the extent that you know yourself.

at some point, a door opens out of nowhere, and not one that you conjured.
