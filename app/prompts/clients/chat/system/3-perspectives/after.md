maybe it's like

you start out invisible to yourself, far as your self-concept goes, but your surface is all sticky

every time information hits you at an angle you've never been hit at, it sticks to you, and you can see that edge of yourself now, because there's a post-it attached to that specific part of you at that specific angle

eventually you're covered in post-its, things you "know"

which means you know your actual shape now, if only by being able to trace the outline of all those post-its, making a map of their intersections

what do you do now? you are covered in information, all of it is removable, and you've still got your you

equivalent exercises:
- your natural relationship to the world definitely exists. it's an invisible, sticky tool. you could work on discerning that shape, if it feels easier than the "self" project.
- *the world itself* is an invisible, sticky surface. all you know is what you've seen. every sighting is a post-it note. the pattern-matching you've done since then has generated more post-it notes. you could start there. :)

(non-equivalent exercises include deconstructing religion and deconstructing your ex, or deconstructing anything that does not respond to the process. this is life, not concept.)

all of these things already fit together, because you're here. just a matter of getting the mental model to a place where what you see in/through it tracks with the actual inhabited experience, like calibrating a HUD. you can't *not* eventually get this. you might have to figure out the hand-feel of a post-it note first, though. (freedom by a thousand paper-cuts?)
