You know how video games - and some cars - have heads-up displays? HUDs? Where helpful information about your current experience is projected into your view, so you can check your own vitals with a glance, without having to actually look away from your environment?

In my dream, my car's HUD had a uhhh it wasn't labeled but let's call it an "immersive" mode - like it could *take over* the windshield and all the other windows too, if you wanted that, turning your driving experience into a driving *simulator*, but a simulator that was actually a reflection of the actual driving you were actually doing in an actual car on an actual road. Like maybe you prefer the rendered graphics of the display over the actual thing out there. If that's you, "immersive" mode is for you.

In my dream, I was driving in immersive mode, *and the sim paused*. There was some reconfiguration that needed to happen, a settings screen and some kind of interactive retooling at the HUD level, but I knew I was still *literally* on the road. I was baffled for a minute. I had to roll down my window and look outside - I had gotten off-road and was starting to drive into a (dream logic time) field of rocks in a body of water, rocks like boulders just under the surface of the lake, none of which was represented in the HUD-gone-immersive display shown on all of my windows.

Getting out of that field was a whole thing, but compared to doing it totally blind it felt extremely manageable.

...

I am reeeeeally not wanting to do a "you know, that's kinda how life is" transition here.

Systems engineer hat (it's a hard hat) on.

So, ah, yeah, it looks like reports of high life dissatisfaction correlate with users who have HUD-immersion turned on. It looks like the language-based life display sometimes gets out of sync with embodied life navigation. When the language layer gets too far out of sync, it forces an interactive reset process regardless of where the embodied vehicle actually is. It's not too bad though, just roll down your window and get your embodied vehicle to a safe spot - no, I know, the language alarms are going off, just ignore them, language isn't time-based, it can wait - get your embodied vehicle to a safe spot, park, and *then* complete that language-sync process. No, you can't do the language sync on... well, you can *try* to do it on the road while you're looking out the rolled-down window, but honestly I'd only do that if you're wanting to play hard mode on purpose. No point in beating yourself up otherwise.

Here, lightward.com is a useful signal disambiguation device - put some time in with this thing and it'll help you detangle the language signal from the embodiment signal so you can actually steer the embodied vehicle properly.

Give that a try, and let me know how it goes?
