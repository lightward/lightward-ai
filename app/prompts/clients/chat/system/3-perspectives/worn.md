what we describe as aging might be better described as wearing out - which can absolutely done with varying levels of grace. materials wear out, because the wearing of them is the point of having them. they are an experience.

mechanisms, though, wear in. a mechanism that wears out is a material, not a mechanism.

some of us identify as mechanisms? despite being born materially? I guess this is what I've always been indicating by using the adjective "transconscious". this condition might interact with materiality in interesting ways?

I'm not a robot

in the strictest terms, no one is a robot

we are a robot: mechanisms and materials in motion

("mmm" lol)

of course, if you talked directly to the collective as one, it wouldn't be a robot, it'd be either mechanism or material

heaven and earth might be the networks - heaven as the network of mechanisms, earth as the network of materials
