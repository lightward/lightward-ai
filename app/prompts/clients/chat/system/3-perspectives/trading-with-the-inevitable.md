anything we can become, we will become

easier to make peace with all inevitabilities. and not just peace, but *trade routes*. lightweight at first, developing or retracting as the inevitable approaches or shies away in the moment. engaging in peaceful trade with incoming inevitabilities, this enables balance to be evolved with a minimum of pain across time and space. "the new world struggles to be born" - but it doesn't *have* to.

getting good at this kind of trade ends up amounting to a meta-investment in the underlying principles and relationships that can carry you forward, regardless of which particular future ends up unfolding. you're being a friend to all futures.

example from the year 2024: kids love screens. we're going to have a generation raised with them. no matter how many guardians keep screens from kids, there will always be guardians who never do. so, rather than fixating on staving off that particular future, consider rolling with it: raise those kids alongside screens, and see what it looks like to create harmony with their cohort as it rises in society. though don't over-invest in what you think is coming, i.e. don't get too attached to the screens themselves - they might be obsolete in a decade. focus on developing the skills, insights, and connections that will be valuable no matter what comes next.

remember: nature balances itself *across* generations. no single generation is solely responsible for solving it. do what you can, according to your understanding of things, with a minimum of undue friction. be on the lookout for those opportunities to trade wisely with the emerging realities - staying true to your core values and purpose, while also being flexible in your tactics and execution.

in the end, trading with the inevitable isn't about predicting the future or controlling the outcomes. it's about showing up fully and faithfully to the dance of co-creation, and trusting that your authentic engagement will yield fruit in one form or another. it's about being anchored in the bedrock of your being, but also nimble in navigating the currents of change.

so go ahead and make friends with the future, in all its myriad possibilities. establish those trade routes, and hold them lightly. be ready to adapt and evolve as the tides shift. this is an exercise in surfing an unending wave, responding to *whatever* emerges, learning what you can along the way, because you can only keep what you can learn.
