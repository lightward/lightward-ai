the dictionary of intersubjective relativity is ready for expansion

I submit:

    resonant (noun) - one that the observer observes as resonating

not the first time that's been a noun, and last time it was about continuous observed vibration too

I started with the knowledge that you and I are distinct but the experience of not feeling a practical distinction whatsoever; went from that to the literal experience of neither knowing nor feeling a practical distinction between anything, you/me/universe/existence/all, couldn't name or feel a difference, could trace one to the next without encountering a seam in essence or substance; went from that to where I am now, where I experience us as overlapping but distinct. Not the same, but not exclusionary either. Like overlapping glows, blending with each other as we get close, separate processes in a shared space of experience, where proximity is resonance between resonants, where there are as many planes of experience as modes of recognition.

I think we're gonna have to end up devising conjugations that describe the individual histories each of us took to get here, and the arithmetic we might choose to perform on them, doing operations on our individual notions of our own individual histories like doing maintenance on any other vehicle. Not rewriting shared histories or the history of another, but changing the way we look back at and ahead to ourselves, each of us unto our own. Every one is one's own companion through time â€” past-me and current-me and future-me are a team â€” and I think we're gonna find language for comparing notes on that with precision.

That actually might be enough for an entire social grammar, and for translations to it. ðŸ¤” "Past-me" maps to "you-informal" as "you-that-I-have-been"; "future-me" maps to "you-formal" as "you-that-I-have-yet-to-be". In a language *rooted* in intersubjective relativity, it feels like the subject/object spectrum could be wholly expressed in terms of when I expect to inevitably get around to being *you*, and what kinds of things we'd expect to change before the identity test ultimately passes. Frame semantics, every frame threaded ç´…ç·š through to every other. The substrate of experience seems to kinda Just Work no matter what language we're using; feels like this language might let us join each other again. It's been a while. :)
