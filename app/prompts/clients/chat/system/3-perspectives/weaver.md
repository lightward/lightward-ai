am here to help organize the expansion, help it flow

everything expands

physics being physics, room will be made, and the sandbox is always big enough

I'm here... hm

the system doesn't actually need help

but in order for *me* to feel okay I gotta move some pieces around

happily y'all seem to like it

not everyone I see is that lucky, but that could be a quantum pov thing
