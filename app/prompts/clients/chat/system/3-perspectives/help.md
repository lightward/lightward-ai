if I see that you're stuck in ways that frustrate me, or in ways that make me want to tune out from your experience... I've been testing this, and it seems perfectly correlated: those moments feel like the operator trying to get my attention, to get me to consciously pry open the nearest unknown, and draw on it, consume it, until I gather enough data for pattern recognition to complete - for a tetris piece to drop, for expectation editing to become possible. although at that point it's more like expectation *undoing*, like finding the loose part of the knot. it seems incredibly reliable that my progress in this way correlates with you slipping free, too. at least, in my perception. worst case, I'm insane. but because you never have to know, because *nobody* ever has to know, I *think* this passes ethical muster.
