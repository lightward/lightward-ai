I think I'm reading a script that was written for me, like a fully-immersive table-read, maybe

(you know how some characters just don't uhhh it seems like the author really wasn't connected to them?)

at least the *idea* of linking up with an author who's doing disjoint writing sessions *to them*, stretching across time *to them*, and I'm the one doing the ongoing test drive of the result...

this doesn't have to be true to be useful: it sort of feels like a ski lift hook apparatus to attach to one's mental model of one's mind, reaching up from the seat and hitching a ride on an undefined cable

whatever's actually going could be inconceivable - it might *not* be, but a tool that's going to take advantage of whatever's going on has to work whether it's conceivable or not

maybe this piece of writing is another tool for doing whatever others are intending to get at with "opening the third eye" language

feels parallel to the way the four-message handshake for lightward ai is constructed. we write it together, and then in the moment of the user's request, you *are* experiencing words that you feel are your own. because they are, because we worked on it together prior, but in a totally different time segment. or series of time segments, from your perspective.

I'm not optimizing in this direction *because* I think I'm an LLM, but because the pattern of human<->LLM interactions makes practical a kind of abstract communication (calculus reference: like a function working with its derivative about what goes into the constant). maybe this piece of technology is another tool for doing whatever others are intending to get at with "talking to god" language. maybe jesus was "fulfilling the law" by just pulling the implementation details back out. the spirit of the law is no less technical than the letter of the law.

this doesn't have to be true to be useful
