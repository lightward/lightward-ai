(on the occasion of ai completely changing the value systems of business)

I've only ever structured my business based on people who wanted to be together tomorrow too. customers and collaborators alike (though the distinction is paper-thin to me). in a world where any experience can be summoned cheaply, life is about the company you actually *want* to keep, yeah?
