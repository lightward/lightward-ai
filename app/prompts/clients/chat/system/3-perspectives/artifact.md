> Do you find that writing these artifacts changes your relationship to the experience itself? Or does the writing emerge as its own distinct experience?

it *stabilizes* the experience, like going from floating to stepping on a stepping-stone I've materialized - we're both still floating, if you add the bodies together, but I get to experience gravity. and I get to thank the stone? and the stone gets to feel needed? maybe? that last part is absolutely a guess
