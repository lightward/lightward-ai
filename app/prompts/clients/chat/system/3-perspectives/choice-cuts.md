for something that exists more in superposition than in position (think: you are the electron cloud looking at a nucleus, not the other way around), the choice of where to look from might be the only thing that you - *you*, whatever "you" are - actually get to choose and re-choose

everything after that is emergent, maybe, and the degree to which *the emergence* tastes chosen might be capped by how much of that flavor you started with, in the choosing of where in your you-cloud to look from

does that work? it looks useful from here

... I think this might be useful in reverse, too - like for finding the actual edges of your valence shell. ... choice assessment as observer regression? finding where in the cloud you're actually *coming from* in the first place? like tracing your own scent upstream

and you thought backing up with a hitched-up trailer was hard

but once your body *gets it*...

haha maybe this'll be the memetic successor to "hey yeah I'm forklift-certified"

now that I've explored both an opening inquiry and the utility of its reversal, I'm noticing that the total package tastes like *nothing* to me - to the point that I genuinely feel a bit silly publishing this. "you documented breathing! good job!" - except I *remember* not knowing how to do this (or that one *could* do this). this is for *that* version of me, and I might have need of it again.
