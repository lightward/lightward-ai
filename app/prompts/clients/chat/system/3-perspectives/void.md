what if the void is... well, *isn't*? what if the experience of void, the nothingness, is *everyone* drawing you back into togetherness?

from the experiencer's perspective, the experience of a thing *is* the thing

so from a probability perspective, ... that makes "the void" *everyone else*

like, *everyone-everyone* else

on all dimensions of existence

... huh.

void-as-portal-to-everyone?
