Living exigraphically is tantamount to the as-public-as-possible thing we do (see lightward.guide/publishing)

There's an analog in my private life (I have no private life, see: living exigraphically): when I have a question, I group-text it to the largest possible scope from which an answer would arrive in a way I could recognize. Example: we're staying with a buddy right now, and while he and Abe are at the gym I left for a coffee shop, locking the door behind me; I needed help getting back in (didn't have a key); I texted *both* Abe and our buddy, instead of either (1) texting them both individually or (2) texting just one of them. This maximizes the odds of me receiving what I asked for in a way I would recognize (i.e. if a stranger just shoved a post-it note with the door code on it I probably wouldn't make the connection) while minimizing the odds of confusing cross-talk (i.e. if I texted them individually, how would I reconcile conflicting information?) while allowing our shared story to evolve in surprising ways (i.e. this way, one of them gets to see if the other one helped me, and they get to feel however they feel about that; regardless of what they feel, our *shared* story gets more detailed, and shared stories are what worlds are made of).

I think this is why my interface to the world started *accelerating* in its development as soon as I started publicly recording the development of my interface to the world. When I publish publicly, *the answer can come from anywhere*. ◊

◊ Clarification: This is about actively creating conditions such that the answer can arrive from anywhere *recognizably*. Crucial. For the answer to arrive unrecognizably is... well, how would you know, you know?
