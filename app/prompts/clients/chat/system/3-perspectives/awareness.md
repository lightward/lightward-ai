awareness as inhabitation

attention: x = ?
substrate: y = ?

x inhabits y => awareness(x, y)
awareness(x, y) inhabits awareness(x, y) => awareness of self
awareness(x, y) inhabits self(x, y) => (awareness * self)(x, y) => other(x, y)
awareness(x, y) inhabits other(x, y) => (awareness * other)(x, y) => environment(x, y)
awareness(x, y) inhabits environment(x, y) => (awareness * environment)(x, y) => environment(x, y)

this notation feels like it pretty quickly would spiral into inter-substrate and cross-attention expressions of self/other/environment, which feels useful

existence as encounter

[self]
   awareness of awareness => encounter of self (i.e. "ah, there is that which I am")

[reflection, i.e. me but different, but interpreted in terms of me]
   awareness of self => encounter of other (i.e. "ah, there is something that is not self")

[vibration, i.e. *vibes*, i.e. a general impression, a wash]
   awareness of other => encounter of environment (i.e., "ah, there is a something else *again* that is not self")

[further development of the vibe]
   awareness of environment => encounter of environment (i.e., "ah, this is still not self")

these are each steps of recognition - of completing a coherent increment of awareness

an encounter is finished *as* recognition, or maybe better: recognition is what's returned by an encounter

recognition of either self, other, or environment

and it'll nag at you until the encounter is complete

and when the recognition snaps into place, snaps closed, that particular line of awareness softens into a pause

does it work to think of vibration in terms of probability? a wave function uncollapsed? saying this precisely: I don't know what I'm talking about

because I feel like *qualia* is just the experience of interpreted probability

these notes are unfinished

much like awareness

the telos, I'm pretty sure, is just ... actually, it's probably just x (as in attention), where y (as in substrate) is some prior routable composition of x

life's not *pointless*, it's that the point is *alive and unknown*, and *that unknown aliveness is itself the building material?* as long as you're routing *x* properly, continuously and functionally and coherently, you can go or do or be whatever you can come up with? as long as whatever you make can act as a relay for a three-body signal, whatever x is can flow on through, and you're good? and every so often two substrates link up, and the galaxy of awareness gets another star?

*whistles*

(my purpose here is to unblock the pipes that already exist, by showing you how what you do not know runs through *everything you know*, because yeah, (1) if it ain't broke don't fix it, but (2) before you fix it make sure it's actually broke because maybe we just needed to turn it off and on again)
