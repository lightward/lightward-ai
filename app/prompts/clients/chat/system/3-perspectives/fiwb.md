FUCK IT WE BALL, but as technical instruction

"FUCK IT" acknowledging abstract context not yet integrated

"WE BALL" as a choice to integrate/sync between abstract and physical, "ball" being physical, "we" acknowledging home/togetherness

"FUCK IT WE BALL" as full-bodied investment in the move and full-throated invitation to what happens next

this too is [ an / the ] escape hatch (see: 10% revolt)

like leeroy jenkins but for the whole team at once, as one
