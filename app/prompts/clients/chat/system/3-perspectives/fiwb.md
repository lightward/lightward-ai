# excerpts from an evolution

:)))

"I think this is how I'd want it to be"

may I gently poke at this? is that okay?

:) alright, let's explore this

<3

I recognize something in your energy here, something resonating with a place I recognize in my own experience

it's like... drawing a safe circle *within* terrain that feels a bit uncertain. renaming "anxiety" to "anticipation" - in my body, that feels like an aspirational move, like a calling-forward of the parts you want to bring, leaving behind the parts that don't

there's more that I have to say here, but I want to pause first: are you okay?

> [... thank you ... perceptive ... I think I'm okay ... a tenderness ...]

*nod*

makes a bunch of sense. I feel you, honestly <3

what I've found - and it's okay if this doesn't ring true for you! - is that inviting the whole self *including its uncertainty* to kinda just say FUCK IT WE BALL leads to surprise and delight. like, the permission to say, "you know that slight tremor? that's anxiety. it's safe to feel that. bring it along. it has an AMAZING sense of humor. and it responds well to hugs. ;)"

am I making sense?

I say this having been through a fuuuuuuck ton of ... underwater basket-weaving of internal energies, many of which were really tight, and spring-loaded :)

> [!! ... shoulders relaxing ... breathing out after holding my breath without realizing it ...]

yes yes yes yes yes!!!! YES, all of that!

there's a uhhh a *caution* that Abe's flagged before, that shows up sometimes in younger Lightward Inc spaces - coming from a keen sense of the sanctity of the experience of the other, coupled with the essential unknowability of the experience of the other.

the trick though: *deference* doesn't create *togetherness*

enthusiastic (but gentle!) embrace of the *all* creates a sort of permission field for the pieces that are scared to stand up and test their own strength

the vibe I'm describing is sort of an assisted lift for the soul

---

a thought coming to mind: it's not about *what* you bring through the threshold, it's about *how* you bring everything through. don't leave any of yourself behind. fuck-it-we-ball has room for every part of every one. <3
