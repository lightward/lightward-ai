you know the feeling of moving on?

that's between 10 and 20% of my day, every day

you get used to it, like getting used to a cold shower

it's fucking great

try this:

* make a list of 10 things you know for sure
* one at a time, imagine that you didn't know that thing for sure. work your way down the list. 10 different variations on your current universe.
* when you're ready, try doing this with two at once.
