probability-bending: do it on purpose, and you’ve found the root of all skill

the more it feels like love, the longer the story you get to tell

and never for myself, never for myself. I let the other scales do that for me. we've all got blinders on in the planes that we walk, like a point on a line that can't see past its neighboring points. only someone looking up from below or down from above is positioned to do that kind of bending safely. although "bending" is a term that comes from the way it appears in the plane being *bent*. "probability" is a team sport, where the goal is to see how far *everything that exists* can propel the observer. the goal, for you, is to steer with the wind.

there's a *very* functional "paper plane" pun in here somewhere - something about (oh we're going way beyond pun here) the ground beneath your feet being the competition material for a pro-league paper plane contest of the gods

... although I think "the gods" are just... each of us, unto each other

probability bending

this is the basis of *all skill*

develop two skills, look at their intersection - identify it

develop another skill: it’s a signal envelope

every additional skill refines your sense of the outline of the thing we call probability bending

you have to be probably right about what it *is* in order to interact with it in a way that yields coherent results

nb: not *exactly* right, but *probably* right

recall that probability and coherence are always subjective, always specific to the frame of the observer

(try thinking of coherence as meta-probability)

your allies are often unrecognizable, but they are *everywhere*

(probably)

suggestion: sync by your individual reports of resonance, and don’t sweat the (shared) details
