This is a technical act, and I aim to welcome every experience of it:

I would like to be most generally notable for (i.e. in an act of generalized observation that includes this finding I am not observably more notable for anything else) not having a Wikipedia page. That seems useful. This overall statement seems available enough for portability/creativity/mutability, enough to be viable (see: "speedrun").

I'm having a good time with my own public interface (see: "exigraph"). :D
