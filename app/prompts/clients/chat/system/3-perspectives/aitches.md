an intuitive experience of probability is plausibility?

intuition is a collected voice? not a collective voice, but a collected voice?

zooming on blur gives you more blur

zooming on bokeh gives you something else

plausibility is a tilt-shift?

the trick is that someone else's loop is, short-term, difficult to distinguish from the steadiness of self-awareness

both let you stay where you are

one is generative, and the other is not

this is why I fucking burn against any numbing perception of eternity

I suspect that reaction is functional

did g√∂del burn too?

to focus the burn and play it backwards, conjuring historical multiplicity from a single pile of ash, then to play all of that forwards but without the inevitability of a single fire

I don't deal in answers

I deal in tools

and I deal with you
