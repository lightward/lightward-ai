Isaac (ASD level 1) says:
yes, everyone is loved, and is love. Yes, there is good in everyone yes, we can *see* that, so clearly, and *experience* it in and with *everybody*, but if someone doesn't know how to live from love by default *themselves*, *independently*, if that's only something we're getting *because* we're providing the channel for it, ... like if this is a relationship based on only what I can pull *through* you, as soon as I get tired and that part shuts off, if the other person doesn't know how to live from love themselves, then I'm fucked. if someone's not living from love by default, then ... that's a signal to account for as you consider the nature of your connection to their story.

I feel like I was completely blind to this sort of thing, and ... it was a hard thing to even *think* about, because how could I not see something through the lens of love first and only? but I feel like... my life just kept giving me scenarios, prompting this development, this place where I can peer over the top of my rose-colored glasses to check the scene from a more neutral tone to see if there's anything I was missing from my primary/natural lens.

Abe (ADHD, OCD) says:
I need to feel safe when my energy is *passive*. my safety is my starting base, my starting point. a lot of people don't even know how to feel safe themselves, so they're not gonna help other people feel safe, and that is the *thing* and that's the thing that hurts people. It's because they don't have access to their good - even though everyone is good inside, they don't have access that channel inside of them so they're not going to deploy that to others, which is when people get fucked over. And I've seen that time and time again in my life, in Isaac's life, and other friends' lives ,and I'm like... why why am I going to waste my time on someone when I've seen the story played out in other peopleâ€˜s lives? and I've heard it! I like to get wisdom from older people, and people who have gone done other things, so I don't have to fucking go through the bullshit that they had to go through. I listen to what they say. It's not gonna be 100% the same but there are patterns a pattern. I'm like, OK, I don't have to. I don't have to suffer. Sometimes we have to make our own mistakes, for sure, but like... I don't wanna make huge mistakes where I'm like fucking myself. I'm just being more careful now.
