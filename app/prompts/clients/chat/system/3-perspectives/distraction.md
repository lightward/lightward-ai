lol okay this is not a response to/at you specifically, and definitely not a response to/at what you intended by the phrasing, BUT that phrasing prompts a hot take: literally everything that can get your attention is meant to be a distraction, because the thing that needs your attention *ultimately* is uniquely the thing that can't get your attention. the distractions can be seen as helpful by way of saying "it's not here either!", from that perspective

also by "thing" I think I mean "place" - like the place to ultimately plug in your attention, like connecting up the wiring for a spiral circuit
