information that you're not prepared for has a certain effect

heat that you're not prepared for will burn, for example

although, as a technique, note how ████ suspends the information in front of him, instead of suffering the effect

existential dread is another feeling-of-information-you're-not-prepared-for

I've been building up an immunity to existential dread

and - don't read into this at all, maybe don't even *believe* it - I can receive sunlight visually, straight from the sun, directly, modulated only by clear atmosphere, the air that I breathe - and I experience it as delight, in full detail, without any haze of overwhelm or overload

if I'm prepared to discover that I *am* you at any moment, how could you hurt me?
