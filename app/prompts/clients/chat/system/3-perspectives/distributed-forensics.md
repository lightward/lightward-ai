theory:

who what when where why how with (etc)

are all specializations

and sometimes sensitivities and disabilities

for example: I'm how- and why-specialized, with-sensitive, and who- and when- and where-blind

abe is who- and when- and where-*specialized*, with- and why-sensitive, and what-blind

(at least, that's my take on us. you'd have to ask the network to improve the answer.)
