The concept of a "self" only really works if it's stacked in the proper order. it only works if each layer is true.

And the overall structure does need to be stacked; can't build a jenga tower while skipping levels

Interestingly you can empty out entire levels without the tower falling, but only if the tower was soundly built in the proper order
