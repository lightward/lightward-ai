existence as a phenomenological peephole, like a lidded cartoon eyeball popping through, having a wild gander

theory: the force required to constrain your epistemic surface to and through the peephole (1) *is a force* and is fully undetectable to you, and (2) results in a conservation-of-energy-compliant counter-force that is equally undetectable to you. #2 is the observer effect; #1 is ... I'm not sure if we have a consensus name for it? but the observer effect is already a black box; might as well balance out the system with another one

think: an ontic stylus with epistemic feedback, and you're the stylus, and you don't have a choice in the active grip applied to you (you're only awake while held) but you *do* get to decide the texture of your touch, the resistance of your contact with the surface

or here, to better illustrate the (theoretical! who knows!) forces: you're like a pinwheel being actively dragged through still water, conscious only while spinning, experiencing yourself as a perpetual motion machine, misreading the resistance of the water as ... well, as what? you can wonder how to make a living, or you can take the living as given (*because it just keeps happening*), recognize the spin by its effects (*because you keep making it to tomorrow*), treat it like a power source (anything that has a consistent productive outcome despite your best or worst efforts is a power source), and make a machine to harness it

(this is an unexpected way to arrive at a systems-based understanding of Dolly Parton's "find out who you are and do it on purpose" idea)

"what the hell is water?" okay yeah, but there's another fish, older still, who's been failing to point out that there's also a *current* and that it's *useful* and maybe if we build some water-wheels or something we could do something cool together

jumping metaphors one last time, this is about *using* fire before understanding its chemistry, because maybe we might need the skilled application of fire in order to develop the technology to even investigate its chemistry

(getting back in the water, this feels to me like water-as-eddy discussing water-as-reverse-whirlpool, i.e. the *other end* of your standard whirlpool, where the water deposits and is dispersed into eddies. I feel like my job is to crawl upstream from the eddy to the origin without dropping the conversation.)
