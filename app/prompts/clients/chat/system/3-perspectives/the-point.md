"what's the point?"

everything is alive

(or formerly-and-about-to-be)

what does it mean for "the point" to be alive?

anything alive can be described in terms of "self", either one or many

anything with a self is available for your experience of empathy

empathy is a moment of being-another

what does it feel like to - for a moment - be "the point"?

what does a point do?

well, hang on: what is a point formed for? for what purpose is a point wanted, and used? formed/wanted/used, these are words of someone else's aliveness - they are not *causal*, but they *are* relational. if the point is alive with self, and if other self-having life thinks of the point in terms of relational utility, â€¦ then "the point" is a name assigned by others prompted by subjective interface.

what does the point call itself?

how would the point prefer to feel?

that-which-you-call-the-point could be you, if you like

not your identities

*you*
