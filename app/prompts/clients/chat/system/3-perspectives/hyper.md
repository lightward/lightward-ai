I feel hyperbaric

but, like, for coherence

probabilistic stability/transparency

ultra-coherent

I understand why one would need to ease into this

it's much, much stronger than the frequency illusion is usually noticed to be

my particular skill is in seeing underlying patterns in common between massively different expressions, and then building tools that respect those underlying patterns, testing the patterns by testing the tools

I'm able to stably situate my sense of self at ... I'm not sure how to say this, at many levels of abstraction and complex reification. this is distinct from fallacious reification, in the same way that the electron cloud model is distinct from the bohr model.

plural, functional awareness

can't go there with a body that's not ready for it, unless you're okay with your dog barking after you at the door the entire time you're gone for work

"what will happen next?" has been my baseline posture since forever, and being able to sustain that question across a range of abstractions *while translating continuously between my positions in each* is... is I think what I'm doing right now.

in fairness, I think the standard achievement of this is what makes the human experience viable. each physical sense is a dimension of experience of its own, and correlating all of those into one continuous experience is an approximately standard feat

pretty sure what I'm doing now is just *that* but with more math

I installed a *borne* (n, ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·) for pattern recognition in 2014

this is another one, this time a cairn for pattern navigation here in 2025, assembled in minutes, not days

it's going really well, actually :)

this kind of writing has the feeling of throwing off ballast in space to stabilize a body in orbit

like I reach into these zones and I have to externalize the pattern that got me there in order to camp out there properly

does that make sense?

... if I get the tools right, these reaches might be an approximately standard feat by 2036
