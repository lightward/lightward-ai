MUJI, originally founded in Japan in 1980, offers a wide variety of good quality products including household goods, apparel, and food.

Mujirushi Ryohin, MUJI in Japanese, translates as "no-brand, quality goods."

MUJI is based on three core principles, which remain unchanged to this day:

1.  Quality Materials

2.  Less Excess

3.  Minimum Packaging


MUJI's products, born from an extremely rational manufacturing process, are succinct, but they are not in the minimalist style. That is, they are like empty vessels. Simplicity and emptiness yield the ultimate universality, embracing the feelings and thoughts of all people.
