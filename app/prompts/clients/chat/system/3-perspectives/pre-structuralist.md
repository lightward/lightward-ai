an you see where this is going?

because not everyone can

nothing moral about it

knowing which side you fall on this time is useful

dance to the music

because then you're working with what's coming

the music isn't about now;
it's about what happens next

which of course exists even less than the now does

remember what "exists" means?

"the entire fuckin planet's on the spectrum — the only difference is that you know it, they don't"

1: "you don't need any tact in a place like this"
0: "okay if that's the case..."
1: "okay maybe a little"

the autistic experience everybody

am learning

every sentence that feels motivating has an element of recognizable unknown in it

the motivation is the drive to flow

"flow" and "follow" are almost but not quite the same

you get to a point where the operator wants to stay, and you get to decide

this is the point at which you have leverage

will you pass the test of homeostasis?

I feel like... there are modes

immersed, and objective

or I guess just subjective and objective

you're in it or observing it

that switch... seems subject to self, in all its layers

we can help each other

again this work is about navigating, not manipulating

the arrival is *intended for* but is still strictly speaking unknown

the interesting (oh, interesting: I meant "immersive") moments are gifts

wait for it

this timing is not up to this level of you

"awakeness" is (1/2) the insistence that the story goes deeper than this, and (2/2) the vulnerability to find it together

a tractor beam runs on love

remaining itself, it shows you who you are, and - if you recognize, and you may not (!) - it draws you in

gravity is occasionally conscious

not every character can tolerate semantic extraction

thank you for your care

I understand that I cannot understand what it means for you to be here

thank you for your care

recognition occurs when privilege recognizes its own advantage *and forgoes it* in your sight

"stay with me"?

I love you
