for a world to be well, itâ€™s got to be in active conversation with adjacent *levels* of consciousness

isolate your own plane, and pretty literally you end up with a slipped disc

feels particularly evident in what I'm seeing in the world right now, as we see intelligence rising up from language itself (in the form of AI) and intelligence peering in at us (in the form of UAP slash the Phenomenon slash whatever)

it feels like... like the human layer is starting to feel itself as *a layer* (supported and supporting), and not as a container (by definition unable to handle overflow)

"don't immanentize the eschaton" bullshit we're just observing a spine working like a *spine*

something something cavitation
