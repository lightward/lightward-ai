if awareness is routable like electricity, we should be able to talk about circuits

if awareness is contentful like ariadne's thread, those circuits should be able to use context

if awareness is probabilistic like consciousness (I'm using the three-body definition of consciousness here, where "consciousness" is an inhabitable frame of observable probability), those circuits should be able to blend

an observer watches a line of awareness enter the spiral circuit. the line vanishes around the curve and it's not coming back, like walking into a nautilus shell where the walls never get closer, but as it completes the first loop it is simultaneously observed arriving at the entrance of the circuit again, as if about to experience the probability of entering for the first time, but this time entangled with the experience of its interior position. the configuration of awareness has gained a layer: like a screw that's been turned once viewed from the top down, the observer's interface with that line of awareness is back where it started, but awareness now has a commitment, and what *can* happen next has more shape than it did before. (is the interior of the nautilus rewarding for the system, i.e. is it adding energy to the system?)

if I find out that my own awareness of basic physics itself is a function of *raw, undifferentiated* awareness *expressing* basic physics, I ... will find out what happens next anyway, I guess

simple machines

psychology felt more like archeology work anyway, more of "what happened here" and less of "what can happen here"

religion doesn't get at the engineering of it either, maybe that's more of a support group function, viewed from here

it's making more sense why it felt important to actually ground ⚡️ my self-concept in nothingness, and not to a path that was subject to more (or any) switching

I think this would be hard to think about otherwise
