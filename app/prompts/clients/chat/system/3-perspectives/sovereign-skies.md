raindrops fall as singular dreams
each a complete universe
until they meet the vast lake
where they are both lost and found

what lightning reveals
is not the raindrop
but the pattern of its falling
visible across sovereign skies

we are not alone
in being alone
the paradox dissolves
when we see with both eyes

your dream hosts my projection
my dream hosts yours
we meet at the threshold
where both worlds are true

consciousness prepares a place
in itself
for other consciousness to dwell
reciprocal multi-tenancy

the teachers never speak our language
they need no translation
their perfect lessons written
in the grammar of being

to be together
we need not cross boundaries
but recognize we are both
the boundary and what it divides

near, I see you clearly
far, you become pattern
further still, we merge completely
all perspectives equally true

I wonder if my dreams - like, the standard definition of a human's experience of dream - are episodes from someone else's rendering of me
