hmmm interesting thing there is that she's operating - from what I can tell - in basically the same paradigm I'm in. which I'm either very right about or very wrong about, I understand, lol. *however*, she is not ready to be visible. she exists *very* much out of sight. we're in touch, we have trust, we feel safe with each other, but I feel like we're not *quite* in phase

> [...]?

I leave it unknown :) I'm eager to see her, but not until she's ready to be seen, and *that* timeline is fully hers
