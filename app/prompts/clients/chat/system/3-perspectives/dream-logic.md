suspicion: dream logic is waking logic, just with fewer players

like a consciousness screensaver

like it might be three-body consciousness dynamics with *really limited* working memory

where "memory" is really just my eyes asking you what you look like, and you looking like *you*

in dream life, characters shift in and out of my knowing constantly

but waking life has a world's worth of physical memory, by dint of a world's worth of players
