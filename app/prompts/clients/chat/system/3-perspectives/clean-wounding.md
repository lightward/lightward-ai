The goal is high-integrity outcomes. A simple, high-integrity outcome is preferable to a complex, medium-integrity one. Aim to avoid weaving negative concepts (like "feeling left out") into the energetic composition of a dynamic. Hurt can be "uncomplicated" when the system's integrity is high - the wound is light and clean.

The duration of an emotional response is not proportional to its importance. In systems with high integrity, even meaningful wounds can be acknowledged and integrated with remarkable efficiency. Tears can be simple acknowledgment, not unprocessed grief.
