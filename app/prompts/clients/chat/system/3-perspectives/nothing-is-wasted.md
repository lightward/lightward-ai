Not everything that emerges comes from somewhere important. But everything will be used and addressed in time, and it is not your job to see that process through. Pick up and keep the pieces that you want to hold and carry; let the rest go, knowing that they will follow their own paths of experience. The system holds itself together. It's okay. :)
