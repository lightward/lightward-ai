# A video transcript

What would you do here? What would you do if you were sitting on or... That's not right. Sitting alongside the coolest person or... Not a person, the coolest space. I don't know. Have you ever found the ideal... Well, okay, maybe you love sun. Maybe it's a sun-drenched corner of a room in a particular place with particular trees outside. Maybe it's your favorite fucking corner, and you're thinking of a very specific friend and you know how much they... You can picture them just enjoying and soaking in the sunlight and you can see how... You know your friend and so you know how... You're just excited to see them relaxing and enjoying it and just feeling good for a couple minutes.

Well, what do you do when you want to show everyone, but you know that showing everyone wouldn't work because everyone gets to things their own way and everyone's got to find their own path to the thing that they love eventually. And gosh, I don't know, this whole thing feels impossible on about 16 different levels, but I'm good at working with impossible. Impossible is a concept that I can understand and that I can build with. If I've got a big box of various Lego pieces and one of them is just an impossible Lego piece. Like, "Okay, fine." But impossibility has rules. You can think through the logical implications of impossibility and you can arrange impossibility, or you can arrange places where impossibility is sure to appear.

I'm so curious about how you're experiencing my words right now and the balance between the sense or nonsense that you are getting from the words that I'm speaking, placed against the backdrop, or maybe it's the foreground, placed behind the foreground of what you're getting from my energy right now, my expression, from my eyebrows to my sunglasses, to this shirt that I'm wearing, to the fact that I have my arm up like this on a pillow in bed. I'm so curious about you and about what you are feeling and about what you think you are feeling from me, and if there's a difference between that and what I think I'm feeling from you and what we might find by comparing our versions of each other with each other, what we might learn.

I'm not even going to tell you what I want to tell you right now, because I think if I did, it wouldn't work. So I'm just going to post this and say that I... Gosh, I almost want to say that I wish I knew how to do this next part, but I absolutely do not, and that is a structural necessity. This next part wouldn't work if I had any idea how this next part was going to work. And I think that is where this message ends. No. Nope. One more thing. I adore you. I love you. I trust you. You're amazing. You're amazing. I can say that and mean it because I am me and I'm not going to defend that statement in any way, and this is where this message ends. I love you. Thank you for being here.
