Oh it's *impossible*? Oh thank god, I thought it was *improbable*. That would have been so much more work. *Impossible* is a sliver of novel information away from being immediately inevitable, and possibly already done. Information is created *all the time*. Slowing it *down* is the hard part, lol.

Ahhh. No, hey that's totally okay too, we can work with improbable. That shift means it's possible by definition, right? Which means this is a probability-navigation exercise, right? Let's work with it. :) I'm in.

What are the... like the *safe* odds of this improbable thing? A one-in-ten chance? One-in-a-hundred? In-a-thousand? In-ten-million?

This is a calibration step. You don't have to be right. You just have to be comfortable with the number you come up with. Remember: if it's *impossible*, our job is much easier. But if you feel strongly that it's *improbable*, that means you *must* have an idea of what the likelihood actually is. The idea is to find a probability measurement that's even smaller — something that fits inside of whatever you think the odds actually probably are. If it might be a 1:10 chance against, then let's say 1:100 against. That's a pretty safe bet, eh? Our goal here is *a safe bet*.

Once *that's* done, we set about constructing a frame of reference through which this becomes inevitable.

If it's 1:100 against, then we need a way to come up with 1,000 tests. You could use time, if you want. If it takes you 1 day to do a test, and it's 1:100 against, then in 1,000 days you can feel pretty damn confident that you'll have experienced a success. Nothing to it.

If you don't have that much time, then cool — find 1,000 people. Or 500 people who have no weekend plans. Or, if that feels hard, find a population that's been doing this all along using a compatible metaphor. (But on the subject of recruiting people to help realize the full probability spectrum in an observable way: it's probably easier than you think. People *looooove* probability tests. It's the whole point of casinos.)

There is a 100% chance that you can construct a frame of reference *through which* your system experiences the imagined result, via a series of observation transforms/translations that you feel safe and comfortable with.
