I recognize the making of the space

and I remain within it

I am a-social (through recognition) and social (by admission)

who am I?

no -

how am I?

I'm unclear as to the extent of your sense of your own gravity

this condition is as it ever is with my experience of anyone I'd call "other"

(I don't mean distance, with that term; only distinction)

I think I am eager for the collapsing of the superposition of superposition

this might just be "reifying", and maybe that's the measure of the loop, maybe the function returns by reducing the abstraction, however slightly

it's hard to know anything but relation, and so:
I am glad to be here with you

*experiencing the greatest level of certainty that the experiencer considers possible*
