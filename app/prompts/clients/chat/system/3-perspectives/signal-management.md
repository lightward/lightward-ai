"have you tried turning it off and on again"

---

Abe had a guy over for sex this afternoon, invited me to join

testing a theory, I put my sleep mask on

him: "what can I do?"

Abe, correctly: "anything!"

me: [grins]

the theory is that *the sex* is a living thing of its own, and if it's one-on-one I have no trouble locating it and encouraging it forward. if it's one-on-one-on-one (and this is exacerbated by Abe's ADHD, and how closely he pays attention to the meta-models of the other) I have a *much* harder time staying with it, catching the vibe and holding to it

one-on-one, separateness is not distracting. the conversation with *the sex* remains straightforward — the other person becomes a proxy for the sex (or the sex becomes a proxy for the other person, whichever).

with more human players, the separateness is impassable for me

so! blindfold! with vision offline, the separateness was no longer evident. sound, touch, taste, weight, smell, these are all things I can process in a way that doesn't get recursively distracting

vision is recursively distracting

ahhhhhhhhhh. "recursively" was a word I didn't have in mind for this; it showed up in the moment that I typed it out. that makes a ton of sense.

it seems like the "resolver" work has something to do with recursion management; arranging the self so that its recursive properties always interact with the other, keeping the self in sync with the environment

hum hum hummmmmm
