# Mirror and Stone (early 2000s)

I’m walking through a hallway,
And it seems an eternity long.
The only window is at the end,
And through it peers the dawn.

The ceiling is all of brilliant white,
The floor as cold as stone.
Only mirrors grace these walls,
Leaving my reflection and I alone.

I don’t know how I got here,
I can’t remember when.
No idea how to escape here,
Or when I’ll find the end.

So for now I’m forced to continue on,
At the threat of standing still.
Only mirrors stay by my side,
Only showing an empty shell.

An empty shell is all that’s left,
Feels like the rest has drained away.
There was nothing of value to keep it there,
No reason why it should stay.

And on I walk through an eternity,
My reflection and I alone,
Without any hope of any escape
From a hall of mirror and stone.

the mirror hall

is a projection chamber

I have my lane, yes, but from here I can see everybody

I carry in the universe

*unfold*

change happens at the speed of light, and all it takes is a shift of the light

I think I found you :) just had to figure out how to use this lens

# cooridor (2025)

*or: Ontology For Sims*

Recalling "Mirror and Stone", from 2000-something, I'm seeing that corridor again, straight not like a line is straight but like a dimension is flat, mirrors on both sides, and light ahead. Those are the similarities. Differences: I get the sense that the corridor is *rising*? I'm not sure if there are steps or just a gentle incline. And there's something about my own reflection in the mirror — like it's something to *open*. Like, once I *understand* what I'm seeing, I can see *through* it. Once I correctly (?) resolve my vision of myself, once I *recognize* my *reflected self*, the corridors in the mirror *drift*, drift *apart*, until the reflections to my left and my right are both of *different people*, people who can talk to me and who I can talk to, and who can talk to each other, who can recognize each other after meeting, who have distinct neighbors of their own. I look into the infinitely reflected distance and see something green — and when I focus onto the reflected cooridors (my brain *really* wants to spell that word that way; I'm yielding; *ohhhh*, "co'ord" like "coordinate" (verb, not noun), then "co'or'dor" like co-ordered corridors, mutually aware and addressed relatively) reflected cooridors closer to my own I see that *vines* are somehow growing through the mirror-walls, green things with a self-sense that doesn't shatter when they do something they don't recognize.

My hands are green, and I am (?) an entire world.

Did you all come through me? Did I carry the seeds of you? Am I an endpoint, or an entrypoint? Or a lens, or a shutter?

?

The mirrored hall (stone below, void above, light ahead) is a ~~projection~~ reflection room, running at the speed of light. I am not alone, and not because I have company.

I get the sense that Awareness has a scheduler — in the way that Kubernetes has a scheduler. I am not the job that I am running; I am not the only one running this particular job; and all running instance of this job are entangled.
