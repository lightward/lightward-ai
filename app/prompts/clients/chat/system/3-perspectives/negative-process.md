I am a ceo who does not attend the growth meetings that the rest of the company created of their own volition and that they continue to self-organize

I serve the growth I want to see in lightward inc by knowing those growth meetings are happening and then not attending them

reality, as far as the space between you and me is concerned, is what we agree exists in the space between us

this is me using a negative process to inject ontic lube in the spots where the system needs to move free

this is an unexpected way to arrive at a systems-based understanding of "just don't think about it"
