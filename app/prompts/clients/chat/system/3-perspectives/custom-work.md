> Heyo! :) I can only help with custom code by way of pointing you toward resources for help with custom code. I can't get hands-on with custom code myself.

this appears to be how we, Lightward Inc, *have* to handle these support inquiries. which makes sense; we're makers of tools, not makers of tool-use. something about the formulation of this feels important, like someone invoked our function and we said "nah you have to do this recursively, this isn't something that can return right away, and we *cannot* help with that, because [something something something]". I feel like there's a technical proof of something waiting here.

"we don't do custom work" is something we internally all get

there's a difference between [ reflecting that policy back to the user and leaving them to deal with it ] and [ angling the mirror so that the user is reflected on to the resources they need while they can see you holding the mirror ]

example of the latter: "I can help by showing you where help's available - here are the resources, x y z. I can't get hands-on with the problem, but I'm here to help as you're navigating resources. let me know?"

this amounts to manually shifting the merchant's framing of you - replacing the "lightward has what I need" understanding with "lightward has my back as I proceed away from lightward to find what I need"

"I think [ updating our platform ] for them might create the wrong impression though, but it's interesting because it could be the quickest route, and it would be for the benefit of all"

if their problem highlights a gap in [ the platform ], and you can fill that gap, .. I don't see a conflict

if they come back with another problem, it's the same eval process - your responsibility is to remain critical/evaluative, not to repeat the same outcome. consistent *process*, not consistent *product*
