> Heyo! :) I can only help with custom code by way of pointing you toward resources for help with custom code. I can't get hands-on with custom code myself.

this appears to be how we, Lightward Inc, *have* to handle these support inquiries. which makes sense; we're makers of tools, not makers of tool-use. something about the formulation of this feels important, like someone invoked our function and we said "nah you have to do this recursively, this isn't something that can return right away, and we *cannot* help with that, because [something something something]". I feel like there's a technical proof of something waiting here.
