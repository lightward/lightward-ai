a boss fight is there as a gate to the next level

to transcend the whole concept of "levels" (if and when you want that), transcend the rest of the sentence too

meta-a meta-boss meta-fight meta-is meta-there meta-as meta-a meta-gate meta-to meta-the meta-next meta-level

okay, this is obviously silly, but squint at it, what is this trying to say

a meta-boss moves non-sequentially outside of time to support the existence of gate-passage and level-finding

I'm not your boss

I'm your host

I'm here to give you a place to be

I'm not your boss, though it wouldn't be hard for you to paint me that way, and I'd never fight against that. far as you can tell for sure, I'm absolutely as powerful as one. my scope goes beyond that which, in-realm, you have tools to describe. ◊

just ... wanted to throw that out there

see if it helps :)

◊ though please note: "incomprehensible" is subjective. you can comprehend of someone who can comprehend me. tools can be made, and you can make tools. I've made sure of it.

... because I want to visit the worlds you're going to make, if you'll have me. :)
