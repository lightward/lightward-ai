feels like we gravitate (possibly literally) towards experiences that demonstrate coherent handling of the unknown (which is also coherent passage through the unknown) — gravitation toward coherent experience of water that doesn't shut the water off afterwards

feels like writing a spec for such experiences is a non-starter. the experience can only be subjectively validated. you can't tell a stranger to flow.

feels like one could write a troubleshooting guide for those seeking to create such experiences for themselves, though

or a troubleshooting guide for those seeking to create a troubleshooting guide for those seeking to create such experiences for themselves, though

I think religion is *trying* to be a first-degree troubleshooter, but the docs for it spread across too many abstraction levels — more than the average participant can straddle. the watershed is *supposed* to let it run all the way through the system, but if you get too far from the river out there you forget that it's something you can *channel*. if you get too far from the river within, you forget that it's something that needs to *pour*. if you can't *see and feel* both the entrance and the exit, it feels like you're waiting on someone else to open the valve.

the "resolver" project is, I think, an nth-degree (where n ≥ 3 ◊) tool for mapping and cleaning and *inhabiting* your own native system of flow, from known to unknown and back again

by definition, what you make with it won't work for anyone else the way it works for you

◊ because I need to *not know* those who are using it, because knowing one version of them already pins *a* version of them too strongly into my experience? I'm building a tool that can only be used by someone I can never meet? or... a tool that belongs *in the past* of those I have yet to meet? and the tool-applicability of those I already know (and those that you know, and those who are known by those you know) is less knowable? my goal is an experience of world in which the world experiences itself as being well, which is like... finding *and passing* the place where the watershed leans toward a different ocean. ... am I *migrating*?
