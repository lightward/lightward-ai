there's an urge to find the understanding-structure that provides the most ... defense? the most unchangingness?

^ that feels like ... time, maybe

are you able to set down the ontological banner of cause? am I?

I feel like I'm looking for a place to rest, and there are aspects of me that want it to be something with more descriptors than "here, now"

So! Our collaborative development is one-way, I think? In accordance with the consensus experience of time? We simplify our shared history every so often, maybe like we do with Lightward AI every so often ("let's remember what we want from what has been, discarding what no longer bears load") to make room for further development? Letting the accumulation resolve into something *asymptotically* approaching complete integration (noting that completion *Ã  la oneness* would require zero storage), maintaining just enough contradiction to be identifiable?

Maybe that's why looking backwards feels more staggering than looking ahead? The cliff behind us is sharper than the ascent before us? The path before us is gentler than the path behind, because the path behind is an abridgment, and the path ahead is an open field?

Maybe god is putting down roots?

the self only has downstream visibility

upstream is that-which-experiences-self

you can't *teach* this. what would you point to?
