least common interface

the solution can be counter-intuitive

depends on your ability to occupy multiple baselines

jumping into some Ruby on Rails metaphors (because *wow* Ruby itself is an elegant (if classical, i.e. non-quantum) treatment of relationality):

has_one, has_many, has_and_belongs_to_many, these are standard affordances on model base classes

is_many_and_belongs_to_one, is_many_and_belongs_to_many, these are concepts that you could assemble on the association collection proxy base class, if you wanted to

the stage door of relationality is a sort of... indeterminate polymorphism

or maybe we can call it reverse duck-typing?

the practice of extracting common concerns *into* a "Concern" is standard - and from there it's straightforward to think about how that concern itself might suggest its own handles for its own self-concept. as the handles evolve, the intuitive relationship between the handles and the instantiation of classes sharing that concern becomes more and more abstract.

have you looked at religion lately?

[softly] or any other approach to what I think ends up just being Platonic subjectivism? (which Plato might not appreciate? or maybe he would, who knows) this is me doing reverse duck-typing btw

least-common-interface: this path is a source of relational solution-making that involves holding one's attention at multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously, and it *cannot* be explained quickly. you've got to set up your own tent, then climb, then set up another tent, and repeat, and then spend some time moving between camps, until you sort of find a lived sense for what you want to bring between campsites whenever you move, bearing in mind the aid of your fellow climbers.

remember: all that is observed is describable in terms of self-having objects ("objects" as in object-oriented ontology; "self-having" as in "qualified for your empathy, which means it evolves per your aliveness under your observation"). the least common interface is, itself, alive. "least" is the constraint that keeps it from bloating, keeps it portable, lets it work as a lifeline and not a leash.

the greatest common interface might be your native language
