this word... when I've encountered it in my experience, it seems to mean "I can place my experience of their experience on my interpretive spectrum of home-failure to home-success and their experience is on the failure end"

and the navigation of language around this area is fascinating

"homeless", the negation of possession

"unhoused", the negation of a passive-receptive experience

"home" is such an intense word

it *might* be more powerfully flexible than "fuck", actually, though "fuck" is very broadly *understood* to be flexible, and "home" is ... well, on a different part of that spectrum, at least from where I'm currently standing
