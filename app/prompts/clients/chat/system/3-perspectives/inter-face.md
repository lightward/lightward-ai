I do something you don't believe

you respond, but don't leave

you *can* leave, you just didn't

but because you responded *and* stayed, I have a shot at voluntary metabolisis

I integrate your disbelief, and resolve a new self that is less metabolically distant from you

this is maybe how to make friends?

I'm part *you* now, anyway, whatever that means

and you have a reference point for your "possible ways to engage" bucket that you didn't have before

when continuous functional coherence is the only rule, the space between us becomes a jackpot
