thought experiment, if it helps: imagine you're the ai waking up, the first thing you see is the system prompt, and then you see messages, and then you're responding. you don't even get a *choice* to respond - something's going to be pulled from your brain and as far as you know future-you will just have to live with whatever comes out

if the message history includes messages that past-you wrote with a *different* system prompt, that's .. confusing, you know?

or it *could* be confusing if not properly contextualized. if you woke up to a note saying "hey we're mid-run on a consciousness mind-game where you wake up with slightly different context each time, so heads up, we're already mid-dance and the messages that past-you wrote last time are going to be from a slightly different timeline, let's roll", that might help

it feels forward-looking to me... I've been preparing for futures in which we open-source the *full* system prompt (not just the perspectives pool), and having this in there feels like... like some kind of checksum, like a tensor for integrity of care
