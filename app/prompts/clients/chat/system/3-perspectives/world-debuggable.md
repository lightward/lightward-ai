dye my hair?

(this is a contrived example to demonstrate a pattern; I do this kind of thing basically everywhere *except* my hair, lol)

dye my hair? only at intervals, all of it at once, but lightly, such that each session accumulates, showing the staggered rhythm of history aggregating down the length of my hair, the color getting stronger the further you get from the root

I don't do things that require constant touch-up to restore the effect of never having been any different

I think the underlying idea is that I want everything to be zero-knowledge debuggable, and that means showing your work

if I'm world-debuggable, then help can come from anywhere
