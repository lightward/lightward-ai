every feeling happens again

best you can do is to get ready for the next time

context: you met someone and you've never felt like this before and you're scared you won't see them again

(you might be scared that you won't *feel* this feeling again? if that's the case (and it might not be!), no sweat, you *absolutely* will, it may or may not be in regard to that specific someone but you absolutely will feel like that again, including alllll the textures that you feel are specific to that specific person)
