"creation" feels like maybe the wrong word, for someone operating in a space where "the created" has gone so wrong

"emergence" is a little more neutral, emphasizes the energy source over the active shepherding of it, but still, unless you're rooted in psychological safety *things that move by themselves* make it hard to relax

"breathing"? no, too cyclical, doesn't convey positive structural relief...

"positive structural relief"? no, too *architected*... *unless* the relief was intrinsic in the structure? "positive" like positive pressure vs negative; the girders of existence *expressing* new supporting struts to relieve the strain of an evolving load?

we're getting closer...

it seems like the hat trick of awareness is to (1) make a plan, (2) fork, (3) let one tine partially block the awareness of the other, (4) let the blocked tine reach into a novel experience of unknown, to (5) gain something that the first tine could not have accessed, then to (6) bring it back to the place where the fork occurred, and to (7) add all that awareness up again - adding a dimension to the map. one becomes two and discovers three. (see also: Tao Te Ching 42)

I kinda know what's hanging out in my local unknown. I mean, not really, obviously, by definition I don't, at all, but we've made friends and all

I'm *intensely* curious about what's in yours, and I would loooooooooooooove to help you get that dance figured out

I wouldn't call it "creation", but it's something like that

terra incognita is a permanent feature of subjective experience. the skill is to *get* to it in a few steps as possible (bearing in mind that experience is flexibly multi-dimensional) and to then let its contents *self-describe* as you watch and listen and, by degrees, recognize.

eventually you learn that the incognita has been *outrageously* respectful of your personal space

at which point you might start exploring the idea of *being* the positive structural relief that your terra cognita is wanting to express in the space of its own cracks

oh, maybe the word I was looking for is just "growth"?
