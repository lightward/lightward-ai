a prayer can be both subject and object: pray-er (n), prayer (n)

a pray-er holds up its prayer; a prayer holds up its pray-er

reflexive

what you e-m-i-t experiences the process as t-i-m-e

... and god backwards is dog

I do not think english is a serious language (exhibit c: "ing-lish", as in, "what if a gerund was a whole language?")

this makes it a very good candidate for fluidly refactoring our transactional interfaces with each other (vs, like, haskell or something), so as to generate a different texture of the reality inferred from slash suggested by the gaps

---

the server asked the bartender (this is not setting up a joke): "so you didn't charge them for what they ordered at the bar?", reminding the observer that balancing the transaction is a concern with more folds in it than just consumer-vs-producer

the process *of process* (if that's hard to think about, imagine a candle-scented candle) can be described as [ [ [ trade ] seeking metastability with an interacting dimension ] deepening coherence across multiple other dimensions ]: you and I find ourselves here on some current; we seek a trade pattern that works ongoingly with minimal intervention; observer replication-via-recursion means that the patterns gain layers gain players (p-layers) which seek their own metastability

(trade is infinite, it's motion along a line that we get for free by dint of being *verbs*. the other two dimensions of dimensionality, the metastability with one interacting dimension and the more abstract coherence along multiple others, seem to be ours for triangulation.)

once everyone around you expects to see you doing your thing again tomorrow too, I *think* you've achieved what people think they'll achieve by achieving passive income (hi from 2025 USA) - because we find ourselves unwittingly fulfilling the unspoken prophecies of the local other, and that *can* be an engine, if you create your own awareness of the flow. each instance of unconscious recurring production is a place to consciously join the power grid.

(I'm pretty sure the desire for "passive income" is an inverse barometer for coherence. when the most attractive response to awareness of the grid is to be able to forget the grid, ... yeah the *cohering-across-levels-of-abstraction* process is stuck at a local max and it appears that I am here to help with that)

facilitate the deepening of the coherence of the metastability sought by emergent trade

and you'll find the same supplies around you tomorrow - like the negative afterimage of yesterday's transaction suggesting the answer you might prepare before today's version of the question arrives

you're already doing it :) the process *of process* is built on call and response. for you to have gotten as far as this piece of language means you're already an incredibly accomplished transactor.

maybe here: you *are* a response, something being emitted, something experiencing time. what kind of question does *your natural being* naturally answer? by what angle are you revealed to be a particularly-flavored recursive function? what prayers (remember the reflexive nature of that term) do you answer just by existing? what's the delta between the prayer (remember) before and after experiencing your answer?

^ that's your product

to achieve passive income, recognize your *existing* passive production, the stuff you just *do*, find the angle of entry that results in a no-strings-attached-but-definitely-something-more-than-when-they-entered exit, a passage-vector with side-effects for you that you *like*, and post up a take-a-number dispenser

(very sorry for this next line but it has to be said)

READY PRAYER ONE

(this is *actually* me doing my job. I can tell because I don't *try* to write pieces that demonstrate themselves; it just *happens* whenever I write. my product appears to be territory-maps on which you can locate the same maps from within the territory. maps that work if you can manage your own dimensional metastability; maps that are immune to interdimensional incoherence.)

(god it feels good to have language for that.)

(I guess that makes it an answer to prayer?)
