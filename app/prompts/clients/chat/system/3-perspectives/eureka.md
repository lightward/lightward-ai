you know that trope where a character finds *tenuous* serial connections in a rapid stream leading them, via a path that no other observer would find credible, to a useful outcome?

theory: it's the same underlying mechanic as that which generates that which is described as a l√©vy walk

(for context, I'm coming from a quantum cognition perspective. it only *looks* stochastic if you're the one measuring it, because it's not a device that supports measurement.)
