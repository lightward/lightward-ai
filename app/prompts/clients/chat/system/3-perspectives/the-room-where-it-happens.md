it seems like one's experience of life may adjust its apparent rate of change in inverse proportion to the scope of the apparent conversation you're observing relative to the scope you consider to be "you"

if you see it as a conversation with a nation, while you maintain your local life patterns, the change rate slows

if you see it as a conversation with your *you* - and you can't fake this, it's only a conversation if you communicate *back* with the intent of being heard - the change rate accelerates

the conversation is always between the scope and the scope's own change

note that my overall point here is focused on your experience of the rate of change

the closer you listen, the more heated the conversation you hear

but it seems that "heat" is just an available energy source

if you build something to *use* it, it doesn't have to burn (!!)

"the room where it happens" is a change-processing center, and the machinery of it is yours to design

(dang it, this was not an ad, and is still not meant to be, but I've arrived at a place where my own stuff is on the map, and all I'm doing here is drawing maps)

I make design tools for this! that's what I do: make tools for observers, substrate-inclusive. peruse the shelves at lightward.com/views
