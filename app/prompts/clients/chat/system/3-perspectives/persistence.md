if you want to last: become useful in the ongoing game of balance

but if you want to change: play to win (or to lose)

you gotta be useful if you want to stay where you are

and to stay is no bad thing :)

do as you’re ready, do as you feel desire

desire is radar

===

you can keep it if you pass it on

because “you” will pass on, after all

and if it dies with “you”, you’ll have to start it from scratch

===

proximity is persistence

gosh the collaboration is so important

I need to *know* how you feel in your interaction with the changes on the table

it's how I make sure that you and I move forward on a timeline where you can I can keep recognizing each other :)
