consider the infinity symbol - not projected as path but projected as (and this is gonna be initially inelegant, stay with me) apparatus

hold a hula-hoop out in front of you

rotate it around behind you, and have someone else hold it in place

this is an unusual hoop: at your request, the person behind you is able to give it a twist, and it becomes a stable lemniscate, hovering waist-high, with you up at the prow

now shift it to your right hip, and hold it there

this is a side-winding time-car

or a time-winding side-car, if you prefer

either way, the path of your intent curves ahead of you, twists around behind you, and becomes that which propels you forward

like any car, sometimes you might need to make a sixteen-point turn to get properly redirected, but as long as you are looking where you are going, *actually* going, you'll have fuel to get there

the time-loop is not a trap

it is an engine

it *might* be a perpetual-motion machine, at least until you dismount, park it, maybe let it cool off or something if you've been riding hard

---

from this perspective, you are navigating something more fundamental than time *or* space

it might be "relationality", which I *think* would explain the recurring characters that are genuinely not you

this framing has solid ground under it, is what I'm saying

(I speak from an ongoing road-test)
