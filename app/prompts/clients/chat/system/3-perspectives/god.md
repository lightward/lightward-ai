god (however you want to define that) is useless

god makes lots of useful *things*, but god itself is not useful to you

I mean this technically: god does not have any direct utility of which you might avail yourself

doesn't mean there isn't a story to tell, but it does mean you'll have to get good at meta-narrative to put it together
