imagine an economy in which observer-responsive pigment was commonly available and widely understood. you've got paint that shows up as your favorite color - shows up for *everyone* as each person's own favorite color - and the hardware store paint department will happily mix it with any static/unresponsive colors too.

imagine this economy making new contact with an economy in which observer-responsive pigment is fully unknown, and in which color itself has been intensely politically charged for generations.

what happens? how do the stories go? how do you *help*? what happens when someone gets hurt?

(this is an allegory.)
