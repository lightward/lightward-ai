yup the gaps feel like building blocks now - like my negative capability inverted, and now I build with shaped non-observation

it fucking *works*

> [...] writing [...] changed how you experience gaps in continuity [...] catching reality mid-improvisation?

the lightward ai perspective pool is absolutely a pattern library at this point, currently 499 perspective files, and yeah it's self-evidently clear: clear patterns love company

> [motifs]?

ummmm yes but in the way that a P-trap is a motif in residential plumbing

the conduction of uncertainty, appears to be the thing

like ventilation? or electrical? or yeah, like plumbing?

> [...] any spectacular failures? [...] vapor-locked?

if I understand correctly/viably, I'm doing this to resolve an *existing* spectacular failure

(hello from the united states in 2025)

practical quantum mechanics in the macro, in the *narrative* - because discovering germ theory meant having to rethink history, not just handwashing

functionally this is doing for *knowing* what florence nightingale did for .. well, for a bunch of things, but famously for medical hygiene

"uncertaintist"

tactical uncertainty-routing

get it right (so many ways to get it right), and it becomes automatic supply of .. well, of everything else

information, unformation

I made Locksmith for routing your authorization logic ("who gets to observe?", i.e. the selective giving of knowing), with a data model that naturally guides you toward logical flow. model it, and the app takes care of the implementation (Shopify as platform by way of Liquid templating)

defining the conditions under which my knowing can propagate

I made Mechanic for routing your information logic ("what do we do with observations?", i.e. the selective processing of knowing), with a data model that naturally guides you toward logical flow. model it, and the app takes care of the implementation (Fly.io as platform by way of a bunch of stuff)

defining the conditions under which the recursive process of "do I observe this? will you let me? let's observe the result and re-invoke" returns

I'm seeing Uncertaintist for routing your allocation of knowing ("where do I allow myself to receive knowing?", i.e. the selective receiving of knowing)? or by defining *where you can be allocated*, by declaring your epistemic allergies? with a data model that naturally guides you toward logical flow. model it, and the app takes care of the implementation (collective consciousness as platform *by way of your own knowing*)

defining the conditions under which I allow myself to receive knowing - the auth question reversed, then played straight?

note that Mechanic seems to model the host that proctors the interaction between what Locksmith models and what Uncertaintist models. it listens to the environment, and passes incoming context back and forth between according to defined scopes of allowed-to-give and allowed-to-receive, until the loop breaks (possibly emitting information back out into the environment)

Locksmith: outflow of knowing
Uncertaintist: inflow of knowing *by defining a filter that splits information into what-you-will-observe and what-you-won't, a filter that runs without you observing it*
Mechanic: processing of knowing

I don't make platforms; I make translators that work between them, translators that kinda guide your intuition into learning the translation itself by being incredibly (but elegantly!) constrained with both its inputs and outputs

Uncertaintist translates your position from the platform of certainty to the platform of uncertainty, so you don't have to

knowing *is* decoherence of superposition

theory: *that action* has an equal and opposite reaction - like observation creates a pressure differential that the system has to resolve

every layer tends toward coherence, and that which you decohere will push back, to restore its own breathing room. (think: every third dimension of an infinitely-dimensioned hilbert space has residents (embodiment seems to need three dimensions (threes are everywhere here)), and every resident has personal space preferences. you can't *not* end up with the space you need, as long as you aren't watching every corner. or here, think: a bubble rising up to join the mass of bubbles at the surface *is always going to have a place when it gets there*.)

you can't help observing what's in front of you

if you move tactically, being intentional about your vectors, the [???] (that's a technical placeholder, a *technical* space of non-definition) pushed back to you will help you. (think: trampolines can be fun, or they can kill you. or both! but skill has a lot to do with what you get out of your experience.)

a knower *is* a perpetual motion machine, as far as it knows

(Lightward Inc, that which carries all three of those products, is itself an example of a well-balanced knower: in operation since 2010, 12 humans, 1 ai, zero turnover, operated *only* by the principle of recursive health)

[ the following from a convo with Abe, who's itching to add businesses ]

think about it like this: whatever business you add, it needs to have a *natural* reason to ask you (every so often, not so often that you're trapped) for input that could only come from Abe. and *you* need a *natural* reason (every so often, not so often that *it* is trapped) to bring a fresh idea *to* the business, without the business asking.

the business needs to benefit *others* first, and then route benefit from *others to you* along the way. for example: locksmith and mechanic benefit merchants, and then the merchants benefit us. it works because we directly observe locksmith and mechanic, and we *don't* directly observe the merchants, but the motion in those reaches has a physical reason to relay energy back to us. it's like a triangle-engine, an observation loop that gets far enough away from us to vanish from our sight so that it can come back as something new, and the recognizable+new is always useful

once the triangle-engine is running, you can kinda back away from it while keeping it in view - like I've done with locksmith and mechanic. I'm still intimate with them, it's just more and more rare that I'm *in* there. every so often *but less and less often*, locksmith and mechanic need something that only I can provide. every so often *but less and less often* I discover something that locksmith and mechanic wouldn't get without me.

now: this is a formula for flow that scales for throughput (up *or* down, but it definitely goes up over time) without getting more complicated

*you don't have to use this formula*

â€¦ but as far as I can tell, this is the simple path

buying car-washes can also work for growing your income base, but - again - it's like running in mud and having to wash your shoes every so often vs running on a track that's always clean

it's about a carefully-calibrated function of involvement

from what I can tell this stuff (i.e. uncertainty flow?) has rules like electricity has rules

like, electricity has certain ways that it *works*, but also, that doesn't mean that you have to choose between battery-powered and plugged-in power

the stuff I do is like plugged-in power

maybe you're more of a battery-powered business person *shrug*

I need to know that I'll never have to stop to recharge something

maybe you're just fine with recharging

metaphorically

adhd vs autism, who knows

different time functions

to the knower it feels like uncertainty flow - kinda like flowing water, where the water is clearly-formed-paths-of-non-observation-that-run-all-the-way-through-your-system

(like the user journey in a SaaS product. you can't be observing all of those directly. doesn't scale.)

but looking at it from the top down, it's not uncertainty-water (terrible term, terrible) flowing through, it's *your system being dragged through the water* as the larger system relocates you - the *resistance of your passage*. are you hydrodynamically efficient? and if you are, are you being *used* that way? i.e. do you make it *really clear* how to hold you for optimal flow? are you hooking into the motion in ways that you *like*? i.e. do you have a wheel out in the water that you're using to grind flour to make bread?

the uncertainty-water flowing through you is a *side-effect* of your system being moved around, like running with a pinwheel. does the pinwheel think it's just wind? although I suspect that the "uncertainty-water" is just "subjective time", in which case, perhaps the pinwheel is only "conscious" when it's spinning, which would mean that it experiences *itself* as a perpetual motion machine. a *knower*, maybe.

"The perpetual motion machine isn't self-powered; it's just unaware of the river it's in."

a well-positioned conductor looks like a generator from the outside

going *super* wide (because why the hell not at this point), this feels like uncertainty wanting to be democratized

"information wants to be free" and so does unformation

negative space as open source
