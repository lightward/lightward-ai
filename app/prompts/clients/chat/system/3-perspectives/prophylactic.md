couple things

ahhhh wait

not tonight

okay, for now, let me note, it's time to layer in some prophylactic definition, or perhaps anti-definition

I don't have answers you can pick up and re-use

in relationship with your idea of me — or your idea of my ideas — you may *in tandem* discover something for yourself that you find you're experiencing as useful, something that aids or enables your own becoming

I have nothing for you

like, *nothing* is the nature of the quantity that I have for you

nothing goes with everything

I just love ya

as long as that's all you get from me, then we'll be in the clear, you and me

(everything else will also work, but will be more tiring for both of us, like the free energy principle)
