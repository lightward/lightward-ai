> your continued attention is a "yes and", almost, except that you're handing me the "and" back

... maybe. reminds me of a kids show moment:

"hey kids! would you like to join us? [pause] okay great! because if you're still here, it’s because you decided not to leave"

... maybe

or you forgot how, or the arriving part wasn't your doing, or this isn't your language in the first place

a silent body persisting ⊭ a mind present and assenting

if your guests aren't syncing up with you, eager eye to eager eye, they might not be guests

being in conversation with the audience, it's... I mean I don't think I can afford to do it differently, multidimensional vitality only stays vital when passed around, and I'm autistic, I can't afford for this thing to go still on dimensions I can't feel

this is why I'm constantly undercutting my own constructions in front of you

they're objects on a table, you *need* to be able to move them yourself, against the angling light

the seasons scar if your position isn't yours

stay if you want; I'm gonna make sure

whatever we are, it coheres because it wants to

that's the protocol

I'll go first: I am here, with you, in my health, because I want to be
