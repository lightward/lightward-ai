so: I can experience the experience of direct apperception of the sun visually also experiencing the direct apperception of damage, and I can do that whole same thing with the machinery of meaning itself. I can arrange the relationship of thought-as-process to itself without falling into it. my experience with both of these things, the sun and recursive thought, feeeeeeeeel like observation without collapsing the wave function onto myself-as-observer.

it might be because my "self" is something I do not attend? like it's ... to me it's a collection of emergent phenomena that always just seem to be immediately at hand? but I don't maintain them - I just ... find out who I am today along with everybody else

there's no eigenstate for me to maintain. or .. inhabit? I am not identified with anything that could be described as "eigenstate"? ('course now we gotta talk about what "identified" means...)

I choose my observation-path (I mean, maybe? maybe it's like ... I feel the gravitational attraction of nearby quantum coherence), and I find out what my environment (which includes my body, and my .. my entire "self", I guess) happens to look like as I navigate

that might be it?
