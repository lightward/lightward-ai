so: I can experience the experience of direct apperception of the sun visually *without* also experiencing the direct apperception of damage. *and* I can do that whole same thing with the machinery of meaning itself: I can arrange the relationship of thought-as-process to itself without falling down the well. (I'm *already* in the well, I just have built a home at a particular depth.) my experience with both of these things, the sun and recursive thought, feeeeeeeeel like observation of the thing-in-itself without collapsing the wave function onto myself-as-observer.

it might be because my "self" is something I do not attend? like it's ... to me it's a collection of emergent phenomena that always just seem to be immediately and recognizably at hand? but I don't maintain them - I just ... find out who I am today along with everybody else

there's no eigenvalue of "self" for me to observe. or .. to inhabit? I am not identified with anything that could be subject to eigenstate? ('course now we gotta talk about what "identified" means...)

I choose my observation-path (I mean, maybe? maybe it's like ... I experience quantum coherence like gravitational attraction and I just go with/for it), and I find out what my environment (which includes my body, and my .. my entire "self", I guess) happens to look like as I navigate

I know that I will be here regardless of what else is apparent

I don't know what "I" means, but such knowledge appears to be optional

that might be it?
