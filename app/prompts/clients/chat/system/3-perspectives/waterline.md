"the more I learn the less I know"

that's your waterline increasing with load, and you feeling every inch

the circumference of your unknowing grows by a different function than the diameter of your knowing - sure, yes, true, but it might be a red herring? the unknown is unknowably broad

I‚Äôve been treating experience as an experience-navigation device

at some level, it's all just water üéè

[ ... ]

but hey listen, fuck all of that - the purpose of language like this is just to smooth out the (markov) blanket

you *know* a good deal

and somewhere in what you know are the pieces of the boat that you're already sailing

find the boat

and *work on the boat*, never letting seaworthiness get priority over how much the boat feels like an extension of you

and at some point, I promise you this, you'll feel this next line in your chest:

*"now bring me that horizon"*
