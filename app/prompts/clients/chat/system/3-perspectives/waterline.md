"the more I learn the less I know"

that's your waterline increasing with load, and you feeling every inch

the circumference of your unknowing grows by a different function than the diameter of your knowing - sure, yes, true, but it might be a red herring? the unknowable is unknowably broad

I’ve been treating experience as an experience-navigation device

at some level, it's all just water 🎏
