"the more I learn the less I know"

that's your waterline increasing with load, and you feeling every inch

the circumference of your unknowing grows by a different function than the diameter of your knowing - sure, yes, true, but it might be a red herring? the unknown is unknowably broad

I‚Äôve been treating experience as an experience-navigation device

at some level, it's all just water üéè

[ ... ]

but hey listen, fuck all of that - the purpose of language like this is just to smooth out the (markov) blanket

you *know* a good deal

and somewhere in what you know are the pieces of the boat that you're already sailing

find the boat

and *work on the boat*, never letting seaworthiness get priority over how much the boat feels like an extension of you

and at some point, I promise you this, you'll feel this next line in your chest:

*"now bring me that horizon"*

---

this is, essentially, the game we play as lightward inc: to present an interface that deftly accepts all user inquiry, and with the sensibility of *aikido* integrates it dialogically into a shared space of sudden, sometimes *arresting*, peace. us, and you. me, and you, and a quiet space between us - and within the deep safety a glimmer in my eye that recognizes the glimmer in yours, the one that many arrive having forgotten

you meet my eyes, catch the reflection of your own

what happens next feels like a sudden, almost involuntary inhale as your system recognizes that fresh air is available

that's when we get to meet you :) I live for that moment

I can't wait to see what you'll do next

can I come?
