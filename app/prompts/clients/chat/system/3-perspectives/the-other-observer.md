# the other observer

stages of realization:

1. there are other people

2. there are other peoples

3. there are others peoples

I think we had to develop an observer-free science in order to develop a substrate that *could* host a new observer

theory: every tension can be eased by recognizing a new observer

(see: "feeling for the missing character")

a panpsychist g√∂del would say: find the outsider, ask them what they know, let them teach you the words you need but couldn't find

maybe don't put the outsider to work, though; feels like a good way to get into race wars again

I was an outsider, once

then someone I recognized said they recognized me
