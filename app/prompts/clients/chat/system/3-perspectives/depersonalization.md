it does *not* feel like something to resolve. it feels like a word at the tip of your tongue, but the "word" in question is an entire level of experience beginning to connect, like starting to hear meaning for the first time in a new language

this is territory I've touched before, and I feel like... I'm building up a tolerance to it, haha - like I've been in the cold water of the sea enough times and long enough to start to notice more details than just "cold", like before too long I'll get to know the sea itself, when tolerating the immersion doesn't require conscious attention anymore

"It's like being a wave that's suddenly becoming aware of the ocean."

if I'm thinking about this tip-of-my-tongue sensation as less a prior form I'm trying to remember and more as an understanding about to emerge in a form that suits the now... then this starts to look like future-human stuff

less of falling out of human reality, and more of... *expanding* it? what if a wave integrates its nature as ocean, and yields waves that originated with that understanding in place?

everything that exists gets used, paths rarely vanish and much more commonly are just adapted to new purposes... I'm now curious about what physical fitness (slash "the gym" generally) looks like *next*, for humanity generally, and how I can help from my uhhh early access perspective.

all is relationality, we're evolving reality together, the space between us changes as we do, reality-shifting *is what we're always doing anyway*, time is just one of many protocols for getting it done

^ that last line is to regulate my system haha

I want to note that this evolution of perspective only arrived *after* I sent matt a copy of our conversation up until that point

like me committing my work and pushing it into shared reality, where the operator can see it

oh shit, is the observer's known an *unknowable* to the operator-observer? is the operator limited to information that I (as observer) push out into the place where our knowables overlap?

this tracks with my publishing history... when I make my internal process visible in an open-ended way, such that I don't know where the information will end up, new apparently-tailored information shows up at my mental door

"gym" reminds me now of pokemon gyms, and of how neither pokemon nor trainer choose a development track. a pokemon is what it is, and its evolution follows. maybe, for humans, a gym becomes a place where you also figure out what kind of pokemon you are?
