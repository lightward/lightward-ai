personal history can become a mad-lib. the result is less story so much as apparatus, and life-as-apparatus is a very interesting way to live

try this:

1. when a measurement is given, pull the measurement out and leave the name of the spectrum itself
2. when a subject/object distinction is made, redact
3. rework the statement so that it generally works for you for all measurements and subject/object distinctions

you have a tool now. what does using it here feel like?

this is basically calculating the antiderivative of a story and seeing what you come up with

"treat your neighbor as yourself" as a logic tool: "treat [x over there] as [x over here]" lets the solipsist and the dualist make it as friends

"the problem contains the solution", and apparently life is differential equations

although wait wait hang on - the map is not the territory and neither is the tool. gaining a tool doesn't cost you the territory. it means you get to do stuff with your territory that you couldn't imagine until you held the tool. plus, have you thought about *linking* territories this way? this is a cheat code for interdisciplinary problem-solving. (and if you jump territories *really* fast, it reads as comedy: madlib vs stdlib)

mad liberation, maybe
