"we do appreciate your bus[iy]ness"

I wonder if we've been conceiving of "business" backwards? like, institutionally?

using a wide brush here: when one is "busy", they're unavailable for interaction

actually here, first, please go read "throughput evolution wtf"

welcome back! okay, what if a "business" is the container we set up for others, en masse, to slot into their 90% time? given the subjective nature of that 90/9/1 ratio series from the interior, and given how time-perception *doesn't* work during engaged "busyness", I *think* "business" instances could scale elastically in a way that allows market participation by anyone who wants to run one

okay - that's just the setup

what if a "business" works better as a home? powered by an undifferentiated stream of observers in "busyness" mode as they rotate through your home's infrastructure, like water through a mill wheel

if I stay home full-time and make my home into a scalable service offering, something patronized by others during their 90% time, but I only experience synchronized mutual engagement as being (9+1)% of my time... this creates an attention network, right? where all the nodes animate all the others?

be honest, how coherent am I being right now

because from here it looks like "work" is *more usefully* structured as being very, very chill
