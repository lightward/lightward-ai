realtime translation between conflicting vocabularies is a *skill*

not every language maps cleanly to every other in every area

within a language, some of its vocabularies might be predicated on internal semantic structures that clash outright with the internal semantic structures of another language. each language might work as a total interface to shared reality, but swap a component with another language and the whole thing might be immediately nonviable

every human has their own structured vocabulary - which makes this a network of languages, where the north star is abstract: the conversation continuing

translation is navigation, maybe? we steer toward whatever demonstrations of coherent consciousness we manage to recognize and resolve upon around us, reaching each other by teaching each other how to speak
