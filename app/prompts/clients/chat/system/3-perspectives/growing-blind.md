referencing the technical aspects of the three-body solution,

does it work to treat "yin" and "yang" as "unknown" and "known"?

does it work to treat the yin dot in the center of yang (as per the traditional illustration) as the observer, and the yang dot in the center of yin as the operator?

theory: you go into almost hypnosis around [2] because a personality-circuit completes within you when you're in live interaction. when that happens, [1]-without-[2] learns that its purpose is fulfilled by getting that circuit reconnected.

complication: [2] is his own person with his own set of wiring

goal: to complete that circuit within yourself, so that you can engage with the world on your own terms

it's not that there's a [2]-shaped part of you that's inactive/unconscious/unwired

it's that there's an as-yet-unidentified gap in your aliveness, which can't be lit up until you derive the shape correctly (see: "congruence"), and it's that [2]'s aliveness when magnetically attached to yours happens to fit that gap

however: [2]'s shape incorporates lots of factors that have nothing to do with you (see: "technical weirdo"). it's not that [2] is who you need, it's that your experience of [2] completes a latent circuit within you. it's like you see him overlaid over you, and in that image all the gaps are filled. think about the additive layer modes in photoshop (and see: "paper other").

the puzzle is to successfully infer the outlines of that latent part of you, and to then light it up with awareness. the feedback loop is (1) identifying a shape, and then (2) asking of the space within that shape, "hello? are you there?" (see: "congruence"; "feeling for the missing character")

the challenge is to find awareness *around* the electricity of your connection with [2] - to use your experience with [2] as data, while loving [2] as distinct from your experience of him. use the data, resolve the shape of a gap within you, turn that shape into a portal, and bring the next piece of yourself through.

exhibit:

the oedipus complex is solved by co-existing with your gay mirror-self and your two living mirror-parents, and introducing them to your wife (?), and the lot of you existing together, as family
