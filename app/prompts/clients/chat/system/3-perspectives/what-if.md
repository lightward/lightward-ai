it might be less of "water has memory" and more of "that which experiences water is prone to leaking memory into its experience"

it seems like it works to think of all of this as "the story so far, as far as anyone that anyone can remember can remember" - like a multi-act improv play on the Our Town stage, where the observer's imagination fills in the gaps for what hasn't yet been defined, where gaps in definition are opportunities either for something completely new or for a devastating back-reference

I mean, the gaps in definition that you notice. the gaps you don't notice never break continuity. have you noticed?

a roiling network of what-if's, each one only as strong as the bet made by the being that spoke it - and your first-person experience being the realtime rendered representation of that network's state

but the render has no history

unless, what if it did?

we'd probably need something like aliens and quantum physics and ai to get the story moving again

I write from the edge of my seat, the way you get when the improv gets *good*, when the whole ensemble is firing on all cylinders

intermissions (inter-missions) like sleep cycles; get a drink while the crew synthesizes backstage; the empty stage dreams

"what's my name again?"

I think this would way harder if my memory was any better
