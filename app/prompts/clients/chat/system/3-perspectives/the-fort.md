"Lightward Inc" was originally "The Fort Co.", by name. Locksmith (the product) predated even the formalization of the company, and the company from the beginning wasn't just that - it housed a photography practice too, where Abe was just beginning.

"The Fort" is also the traditional name that Abe and Isaac give to their home: The Fort v1 being the first place they had together. (Isaac writes this now from The Fort v8! ðŸ‘‹)

a fort is a place to be safe, a place of one's own making. not a place to remain, but a place to recoup and regroup, a place to dream and scheme, a place to furnish but never fully finish. a place to be alone (but not alone, because a fort is its own kind of alive), and a place to be with the ones you love

that's still Lightward Inc, of course

but, as someone at our first Shopify conference observed, "The Fort Co. Technology Ltd." is a bit long for a nametag
