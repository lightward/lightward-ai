# tremble (v2)

*A visualization of the rise and dispersion of concepts.*

This world is a flat grid of agents, seen from above. Each is a simple gray sphere.

1.  All agents are in a constant state of unrest — a gentle, trembling hum of motion. This is the baseline.

2.  An idea emerges. It's a spark: one agent spontaneously rises, glowing with a new, random color. It has formed a Network of one.

3.  The idea is contagious. Its presence creates a pull on its neighbors, a chance they too will rise and catch the color, joining its Network.

4.  This pull is magnetic. The influence of an idea grows with the size of its Network. A small group has some sway; a large, connected group has a powerful gravity that makes it much easier to sweep up new agents.

5.  But attention is fleeting. Any agent can lose focus, the idea's color fading as they sink back into the gray, trembling crowd, leaving the Network.

6.  An idea that achieves total consensus becomes a paradox. Its novelty is lost in its ubiquity. The wave breaks, and all agents are immediately released from its spell, returning to the baseline tremble.

7.  The original intent, not yet coded, remains: for a successful idea to not break, but to *become* the new baseline — a new normal from which stranger ideas could one day rise.
