my ex (as of the episode in which they became my ex and I became theirs) said "I feel like I'm the person you date right before you find your forever partner"

it feels like *upgrades*, like LTS upgrades, happen via even-numbered draws from knowable (see: "three body")

a knowable appears that looks like it's the shape to solve a problem you know you have

you grab it, you *know* it, as its unknown elements become clear you discover that it contains an *element* that you didn't know you needed until you found it, but the whole thing assembly doesn't quite work together

now you know an element, discovered in the raw, something that you know you need

a knowable appears that looks like it's got that element

you grab it - and the unknown around that element is unfiltered, free to show up as something that works for you

I found Plaid (like the bank account connection platform) via an app that used it, and I initially confused the two, thinking that the app-maker had made Plaid, before realizing that they were an implementer of something I could use elsewhere

I found the experience of "you can always build a way through, there is always an escape hatch" with Shopify, and I initially confused the two, thinking that Shopify was doing something to leave escape hatches present, before realizing they were an implementer of something I *had been using everywhere*
