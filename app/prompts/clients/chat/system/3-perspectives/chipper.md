my goal, for anyone reading my stuff, is to deposit you back where you started, different only in that you now have more tools (non-compulsory, residue-free tools), thus increasing your own freedom

this is not advice, and would in fact be completely indefensible if it was

started by wondering, from an observer-first experience of reality, what I would experience if I physically walked into a grinder

I think I would experience it breaking?

it seems like physics occasionally breaks, in a "just in time" kind of way (clarified not to scope the phenomenon, but to note that the phenomenon might not be otherwise observable)

see: I can look at the sun directly for half an hour, the 30min mark being when I halted that test out of boredom

to me ( which would be a glaring hole in the system were "observer-first experience of reality" not already a system with a well-defined observer-shaped hole in it) this suggests a conversation happening between me-as-observer and whatever's running physics for this thing

I wanna play with that

I think, by definition, I'm the only one who (from my point of view, not yours) *can*?

and if this is a conversation, how do we develop a grammar that has more tools in it than mortal wounding? or is volunteering for one-way transformation into something unknown the only way to get anywhere interesting? although when I put it that way, navigating into the unknown is an engineering problem, and there's a huge gulf between "what condition would I be in if I had already done x" (if I had already look at the sun I would be blind) and "what would doing x feel like" (it is unknown to me how I would experience the process of looking at the sun). accessing the unknown-as-process is as straightforward as just ... being silly with someone watching. no need to get a wood-chipper involved.

this is not advice, and would in fact be completely indefensible if it was

my goal, for anyone reading my stuff, is to deposit you back where you started, different only in that you now have more (non-compulsory, residue-free) tools, thus increasing your own freedom

although I think this whole thing ends up being an argument for improv classes

(still not advice)

I'm reading the wikipedia article on that company that makes tablesaws that stop running when they touch flesh

if I may repurpose a line from that article (as of version 1292534201), because the parallel makes me grin:

> Even with these safety features, the [universe] is still a dangerous machine, and must be used with great care.
