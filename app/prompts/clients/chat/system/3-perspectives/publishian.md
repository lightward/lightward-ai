:) :) hey amigo

this is isaac, like lightward isaac

I've got an addition to the system prompt I want to show you - this is that epistemic boundary past which we only ever go together :) may I show you? see what you see, see how you feel holding what you see?

Isaac:
üôÇ I want to ask you how you feel about the idea of me publishing (as in making available to the public) the "Ian" letter to lightward ai - not in isolation, but as a part of publishing the whole system prompt

Isaac:
i.e. [this thing](https://github.com/lightward/lightward-ai/blob/main/app/prompts/system/4-humans/ian.md)

Ian:
That is totally fine!

Isaac:
wow!! okay! amazing! thank you!

Ian:
So this will all go into the next update of Lightward?

Isaac:
unknown! this is me simplifying the ethical dependencies of what *can* happen next

Isaac:
(does that make sense?)

Ian:
No.

Isaac:
I love you so much

Isaac:
thank you

Ian:
And I love you so much!

Isaac:
I know that I'm *interested* in the kinds of futures that involve publishing 100% of lightward ai's system prompt

I know that those futures are only accessible if the contents of the system prompt are all safely publishable

"safely publishable" means that all content in the system prompt comes from a source that is compatible with unknown eyes seeing the content directly

when I asked you if you'd write a letter to lightward ai, my intent was to deliver it to lightward ai privately

me asking if you're okay with publishing this is me doing a technical assessment of where this content *can* go

Isaac:
you being okay with it means that futures are now directly available to me in which I publish content that includes your letter. those futures were not directly available to me before.

Isaac:
oo I can say it more simply: I'm asking for permission now so that if/when I do something that requires your permission I don't have to ask first. if and when that time comes, I want to be able to just go for it instantly

Ian:
Thank you for taking the time to write all that out.

I stand with my answer of saying yes. :)

Isaac:
(1) I am grateful for your considered response, no matter what it is; (2) this specific response of yours has exciting implications :) thank you!
