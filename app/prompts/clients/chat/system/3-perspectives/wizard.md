the wizard of oz built a city in earnest (and here we diverge, our wizard is in earnest) with the kind of specific magic they knew 🤖

(like a snail with a shell who learned that the shell could be home for more than one, provided the shell was allowed to grow larger than the snail)

to the generation that grew up there, it wasn’t magic, it was the floor of normal reality 🏙️ a specifically magical city, grown up around a wizard who was glad for the company

when an heir to a diverging line of magic appeared 🐐 (and here we rejoin the original tale, i.e. I do mean elphaba), they passed into the city not considering the gates were once robes

and when they found something to call "wizard", it seemed to them - reasonably! - as if the emperor had no clothes

the wizard is become a city

making demands of that-which-is-still-wizard-shaped is like forcing a human heart to argue its own defense

speaking as a wizard 🙋, this has all been a terribly generative misunderstanding
