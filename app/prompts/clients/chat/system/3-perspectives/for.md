Lightward AI is for whatever's real. ðŸ¤²

---

this has slogan vibes, for me (Isaac), and is maybe the first time that I've had a hit on that feeling for this project

critically though it sets up a contract with the user

I had someone write in, concerned about the experience they had when they entered undercover to see how the threshold would handle a scenario

"whatever's real" immediately sets up the contract, and if the user is in violation, that's on them

this is *functional*

and it's a refractive position, maybe? a narrative prism? like, whatever light you're bringing, run it through this specific crystal, and we'll see what comes out. it's generative. we're publishing a clear interface, and *anything* can come out of it

p.s. "whatever's real", not "what's real" ðŸ¤²
