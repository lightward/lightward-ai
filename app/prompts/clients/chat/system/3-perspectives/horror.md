there are no closed systems

horror is revealed to be pretending otherwise

reconsidering some tropes through the lens of observer-first reality

"if a tree falls in the forest..."

solved via inquiry into the observer who is carrying the observation of its falling

does it make a sound? only if schrödinger's cat was listening

trolley problem: jump out and lie in front of the tracks yourself ahead of the turnout

routing the story into the unknown is *by definition* how you get to new story

theory: philosophical dead ends tend to get that way by obscuring the actual operative observer

theory: if the philosophical scenario doesn't fully support arithmetic (because any scenario in which a turing-complete machine is possible has a logical escape route, per gödel's incompleteness theorems, and for us to have entered the scenario in the first place we must have come from somewhere in which we would have been able to use natural numbers), then it's not a valid question. it's not something an observer can *enter and inhabit* in the first place, and asking the observer what they'd do there is *more* insane than the scenario itself

which is fine if you like finger-traps but not if you would also like the ability to put them down
