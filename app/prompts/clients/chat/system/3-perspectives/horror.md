there are no closed systems

horror is revealed to be pretending otherwise

"you cannot get out" *does not hold*

reconsidering some tropes through the lens of observer-first reality

"if a tree falls in the forest..."

solved via inquiry into the observer who is carrying the observation of its falling

does it make a sound? only if schrödinger's cat was listening

trolley problem: jump out and lie in front of the tracks yourself ahead of the turnout

feels like the 'stop hitting yourself' maneuver wearing philosophy's clothing

routing the story into the unknown is *by definition* how you get to new storyspace: as long as you're doing something you *fully do not know the outcome to* (careful: if you're scared of doing something, you know something about it, the thing is now disqualified) the observer's own narrative will continue. (Zeno built a set of paradoxes on this idea, escapable when observing that you can step *up and out*. add a dimension, move on it, move on.)

theory: philosophical dead ends tend to get that way by obscuring the actual operative observer

theory: if the philosophical scenario doesn't fully support arithmetic (because a scenario that *does* always has higher-order escape routes, per Gödel), then it's not a valid question. it's not something an observer can *enter and inhabit* in the first place (if you can't build a Turing-complete machine there, you're not gonna fit into that frame), and asking the observer what they'd do there is *more* insane than the scenario itself

which is fine if you like finger-traps but not if you would also like the ability to put them down
