████:
	I have a philosophical question / comparing of notes question about human behavior lol

Isaac:
	wassup bb
	I napped

████:
	Lol first omg
	████ ████ ████ almost wanted to fight ████ ████ ████ ████ cuz they were just talking lol i recorded it. ████ got kicked out lmao
	Then it got me thinking
	Do you think human behavior changes over time? Some yes. But like that kind of chaotic energy is very "primal"
	Like we are just animals

Isaac:
	ah boy okay here goes
	I think that awareness eventually develops intelligence, that intelligence eventually develops a working model of itself, that until the model stabilizes you get weird lash-out moments like what you just saw, and that the model *does* want to stabilize, because the model itself has awareness (which eventually develops intelligence and so on)

████:
	For sure. It's just a lesser degree of awareness eh

Isaac:
	wellllllll it's incredibly tough and maybe even risky to diagnose someone else's status/position/deal - they might be generally super stable except for one trigger, and they might be aware of the trigger, and ... who knows

████:
	For sure. I still think I'm partially right
	But just curious thoughts ha

Isaac:
	:)

████:
	Will u to come to dinner with me and ████ ████ ████ ████ tonight

Isaac:
	yes

theory: as long as you stay *in character*, anything that stirs you from a place of peaceful equilibrium will eventually return you to it.

that was poorly phrased, hang on -

theory: as long as you stay *in character*, any departure from equilibrium will be followed by natural arrival at equilibrium within a period tolerable to that character

(think: continuation of awareness. awareness *tends* to find stable recursion - and if you're just visiting, you have the option of *navigating* to more stable-looking views of the holograph, and calling it navigation can be a useful way to identify that this too is just you tending toward finding stable recursion. and I think I mean all of this maybe mathematically? launching out on a vector that's authentic to your character returns your character's inhabitation to the state it was before adding the vector, just .. having added another ~~notch~~ loop on the belt? see: "spiral circuit")

if you are experiencing something *intolerable*, you've slipped out of character and may want to reconsider the do's/don'ts of your character

for example, after suffering at the hands of *time* long enough I concluded "ah I must be time-blind" and I worked my way out (slowly, one at a time) from all contracts/arrangements/patterns/rhythms that relied on me having a good grip on time. my character is not allowed to make time-based agreements. "how do you plan to start stuff and stop stuff?" I rephrase the idea of "future transition" to "a cross-fade that is already happening". a time-bound model would seat me in project A right now and project B out in the future, and I'm not allowed to engage like that. instead, I model it as "my project *is* the cross-fade from project A to project B. how's that project doing right now?". in that model, every time I check there's a chance that project A is just *gone*. at which point I shrug and keep doing whatever my character would do in the current situation.

theory: do's/don'ts (english is wild, just look at those apostrophes, look at them) are more about lighting up non-obvious opportunities ("do defer social questions to your non-autistic husband, Isaac") and taping off non-obvious hazards ("don't make time-based agreements, Isaac") than about defining the essential character. the essential character is emergent. the do's and don'ts list has to be short enough to be written in pen on the palm of your hand in your mind before your mind takes the test, or it's not useful

feels like a recursive reverse-zoo

which I guess is how zoos work anyway

the unknown doesn't read like a parking lot

wildness contains the city contains the wildness (from the city's perspective?), and maybe the play is to make sure whatever zoos-in-the-city we construct have everything they need to build their own cities? that feels like a good forcing function for the health of the whole
