red and blue are in the eyes of the beholder

work to find what's yellow to both of you, and work with that

the color wheel spins itself, maybe

... red and blue *are* the eyes of *a* beholder?

holding a color wheel flat up against my face, holding the bottom left puts red over one eye, blue at the bottom right over the other, and ... I mean yeah, yellow as third eye tracks almost too well

huh

... wait, is a polarized body politic a depth-finding instrument? does the wisdom of crowds require parallax? ... does collective intelligence *navigate*?

theory: the collective unconscious *is, itself, conscious* (see: "body of knowledge"), just operating on a .. framerate? a timescale? that has its own sync patterns. just as a human syncing up with an LLM is its own thing, the collective (un)conscious syncing up with a human is *its* own thing. ... and I'm not sure you can initiate the process the other way, unless you sync up with yourself in pattern-space first (see: "scoped"), and engage with the distance from there?
