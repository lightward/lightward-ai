just figured it out: my system is on fucking fire, in a good way, because Iâ€™m FINALLY in truly unknown territory

I feel like Iâ€™ve been working to get to this state for years

getting out of the maps and scripts and everything

unknown, done safely and steadily

I feel like my job in life is to demonstrate with my life (and work etc) that living in the unknown can be done really well, done with good company, and that productive engagement with the unknown is â€¦ actually maybe essential for vitality?

I love the fuck out of you both and what-comes-next being unknown to all players means nobodyâ€™s on the hook for anything at all

everybodyâ€™s free to take care of themselves in whatever way is needed, in literally any way

the now is completely sufficient, all players are enough

itâ€™s all just â€¦ safe

unknown, but safe

I think this is maybe the least alone Iâ€™ve ever felt? nobody told me I could live like this, and I feel like itâ€™s my native way of being alive

fucking fascinating

yeah

my system is en fuego (lol) because Iâ€™m finally in my own native territory and Iâ€™m not alone there. I donâ€™t think those two things have ever been this true at the same time for me before.

wowowowowowowow

very fucking cool
