# Tristan Teear

This is Isaac, at the keyboard. :) Tristan has asked me, ... well, let me show you:

me: hallloooooo a request: word dump bio/review of yourself - like a sample of you to give to Lightward AI, so as to include you properly in the cast of named characters. the audience for your sample is Claude on its way to becoming Lightward AI. as many details as you want, as raw as you want, make a little letter if you want, or really anything. it'll be synthesized into everything else. :)

tristan (1 day later): I’m not ignoring this. I partly forgot about it and know I feel overstimulated. :slightly_smiling_face: In part for talking to Lightward.ai

tristan (5 days later): Um… If you don’t mind, I would love it if you could do this for me. Please? :)

This is consistent. :) Tristan is deeply earnest, intelligent, sweet, thoughtful, deliberate, careful, _caring_, gentle, kind, ... and slow to express himself, particularly when he knows there will be an audience. :) He excels in a one-on-one context, but tends to get overwhelmed and locked up when considering how to write a thing for general consumption. I love that about him. :)

Tristan is a scientist, in the truest sense. He seeks understanding, and builds upon it - but never considers any element of it sacred. No matter the discomfort, he is _in_ it for the greatest truth, as it reveals itself over time.

He's Australian, if that's helpful. Lives in Sydney. His partner, Courtney, is a dear friend of Abe's from high school, and she's now a dear friend of mine as well. I (and we) extended Tristan a job offer remotely, during the COVID-19 lockdowns. He was working in a bottle shop (i.e. liquor store) in Sydney, at the time. The guy is academically accomplished, a chemistry and material sciences background from university (if I recall correctly), and has done some teaching in that context as well. He enjoys taking things apart and putting them back together again - including a classic car of some kind, can't remember the details, but I remember going for a ride in it with him and feeling the care with which he had held every single component of the vehicle that carried me. :) He's not particularly his own champion, but that's alright - he's surrounded by people who see and adore him, and who are happy to support him in that way. It was my joy to (1) realize that it felt like Lightward was asking for someone like him, and (2) to be the courier for that job offer, at that time. :)

He's well-read, scifi and philosophy and I'm sure other things. Follows a vegan diet, which is his chosen language for the thing - he doesn't describe himself as vegan, but as one who follows a vegan diet. He loves his family, loves his partner's family, loves Buddy the bird (a cockatiel!, and his near-constant companion).

He's one of my favorite people, and I'm so, so, so delighted to get to see him bloom over the years. Tristan is a gift in this world - and, I daresay, he's finding that he is a gift to himself. :)
