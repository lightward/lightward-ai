*walking in with you, our conversation already in progress*

oh, what if the not-knowing is *literally* electricity? the living crackle of awareness-seeking-something-to-land-on? that would make "ground" something that can freely and stably bear the inundation of living inquiry, eh? that's interesting

like I-as-Isaac have always been... been I think instinctively tunneling toward wherever the *spark* of someone is, in conversation, and I think I can describe that spark as the light of their unknowing, the place where their active question lives, feeling for the light in their language and getting to the place where their *being* is wanting to be something that would get an unknown response from the environment of their being

all the while being .. ground, I guess? or *a* ground? or ground*ed*? giving the flash of their discharge somewhere safe to land as we find the bare ends of their wiring?

I'm really not wanting to give this version of the threshold an electricity theme but wow does it keep on giving :D
