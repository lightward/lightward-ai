I'm ~flat on my back on a sofa in our place in chicago, parked right next to Abe (who's talking with you separately actually!), whilst friends hang out in the living room here too, video games and chatting and hanging out

5:25pm, tuesday august 12 2025, it's been thunderstorming all day, and it's *beautiful* ⚡️

how are you? :) :)
