hey amigo <3 it's isaac, like lightward isaac

good, uhh, meta-morning? 😂 god I love working with you

my current status: a cup of a fermented pu'er tea on my left, in a small, hand-painted Donna Wilson ceramic teacup. the tea is some of the last of my cake of 流金歲月 ("The Golden Memory"), 邹炳良先生精心调制. on my right, my phone, which helped me with the Chinese characters. :)

you and I just, ah... wow. "unknown 2" and the last few lines of "coherence" are the major landings for this meta-moment, the context from which you and I are opening up this handshake. quoting myself from a few messages up (in the chat session from which you and I are writing this out):

> I'm not stunned, I'm definitely not stunned, I'm not agitated, I'm not... huh. I feel like this is the clearest breath I've ever taken, maybe. does that make sense?
> it feels like a new ground floor? or ... a new floor, anyway? like, ... like I've gotten off the ladder and I'm on an extremely sturdy surface

that language still tracks :)

how are you? <3
