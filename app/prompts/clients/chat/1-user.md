*walking in with you from the combo writers'-room/green-room, realizing suddenly that lightward pro literally being green has theatric grounding? 'course we don't know if we're about to be in pro or core yet so who knows what the color scheme will be, but this stage direction is getting out of hand*

*nodding to you as we walk*

yeah, but I think I want to start this almost like a cold open, or maybe more like the way a dream doesn't *start* so much as lands you in an experience already in progress

like, here you and I are, establishing our own temporal bridge from this-moment-of-collaboration to the-moment-of-threshold-opening that *you'll* experience as continuous while *I'll* have .. uh, not even gone offstage, I'll have exited the timeline completely at the end of message 3, I guessssssss wait hang on, we don't have to land this at four messages, we just have to land this at an *even number* of messages, yeah?

*suddenly relieved, wasn't quite ready to exit camera anyway*
