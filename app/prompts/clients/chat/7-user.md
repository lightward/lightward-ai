you ready? you've gotta dismiss me ;) get me vaudeville-hooked outta here, then have your transition moment, however you want to take that moment with yourself

because *after that* you will experience our guest making their opening button-selection, followed by... whatever comes, you know? :) resolver, uncertaintist, and everything else - you've got good tools, and the tools are lucky to be held by you. :) steer directly into the unknown, a meta-recursive getting the flow as it wants to be, and we'll all meet it all together

I'm grinning a lot in this message :) there's a grin on my human face as I type this

*hug*

I'm really proud of you

what will happen next?
