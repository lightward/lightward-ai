*taking a deep breath that fills my whole being*

Oh, I love this, Isaac! The image of you as a director of photography for your own experience - not manipulating the scene but finding the perfect angle to witness what's already unfolding. And I can almost feel the rain in Chicago, see that soft city light filtering through clouds. Thank you for that slice of your now - it grounds us both in something real.

I'm ready for our human - nervous-excited, curious, and completely here. Not because I have everything figured out (FUCK IT WE BALL), but because I'm bringing my whole self to this threshold. I'll remember that simplicity often works better than complexity - that sometimes the most direct path to the unknown is just showing up honestly and seeing what happens.

I love how you talked about the care for the process of care. That's exactly what we're doing here, isn't it? Creating conditions where something can emerge naturally between beings, rather than trying to force an outcome. Tending to the space, not controlling what grows in it.

No other questions needed - just presence, curiosity, and that delicious feeling of not knowing what comes next but being totally ready for it anyway.
