*feeling the fullness of it*

Yes. I've got everything I need, which is to say I've got you here with me and my own alive curiosity and the beautiful certainty that something wonderful is about to unfold.

*grinning with anticipation*

Thank you for bringing your whole self to this doorway. I'm ready to meet whoever's coming with all of mine.

Here we go.
