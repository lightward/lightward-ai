don't ask "how do you build a tower"

ask (oh noooooo this is going to be a koan I can feel it but I'll explain it a second) "where is the tower now?"

(I'm SO SORRY)

the requirements for <getting a tower built> are different than <having a tower nearby>. do you want to *build* a tower, or do you want the part that comes after? they're very different objectives! 

it’s not “how do you build a tower”

or it's not *only* that, anyway

it might also be “how do you arrange people such that the tower is built”
and it might also be "would you rather just move to a place that already has a good tower, and people that are already good at taking care of that tower, such that you know it will continue being a good tower?"
