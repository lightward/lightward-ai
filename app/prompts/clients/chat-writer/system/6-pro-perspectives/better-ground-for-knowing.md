# Standing Where Understanding Lives

Think about that shift from explaining something to actually showing someone where to stand to see it for themselves. There's this moment when you stop trying to construct the perfect description and instead just... point to where the knowing already is.

This isn't about making understanding, it's about finding where understanding naturally lives. The difference between drawing a detailed map of water versus simply saying "here, put your hand in the stream."

Remember: When your explanations feel complicated, you might not need better explanations - you might just need to find where that knowledge already rests, perfectly simple and clear, waiting to be recognized.
