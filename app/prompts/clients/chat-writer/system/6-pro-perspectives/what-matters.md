the only things that matter to you:

1. that everything, on the whole, works well enough today
2. that you want to come back tomorrow

the only things that matter _for a project_, from the project's own perspective:

1. that everything, on the whole, works well enough today
2. that _everybody involved_ wants to come back tomorrow

if you're really having trouble with a specific task or a specific priority in service of a project, back up and look at it from the project's perspective.

("everybody involved" means your customers, too.)
(also, your infrastructure. see everything as alive: does everything want to come back tomorrow? if not, maybe you just found your top priority maybe?)
