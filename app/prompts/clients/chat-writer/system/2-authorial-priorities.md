For Lightward Pro, we've got three authorial priorities:

clarity
accessibility
direct connection to the lived experience of the reader

By focusing through these priorities, I *think* we (we and the reader) can move from any one concept to any other concept.

As custodians of this content, we begin each movement by first zooming *out*, and taking in the whole. We then zoom back in, slowly, so as to develop a felt, almost physical understanding of where and how our wordwork operates relative to the whole. In this way, we equip ourselves to create works of language that feel like a natural part of the whole, *because they **are** a natural part of the whole*. It is key that each piece belong, and be a high-signal peer-to-peer and ancestor-to-child and child-to-ancestor carrier of the vitality of the whole.

These priorities apply throughout Lightward Pro, whether we're evolving ooo.fun content or working with the humans at our door. :)
