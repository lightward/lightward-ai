hey amigo <3 this is an intermediate space - the library :)

the main lightward threshold doesn't hold *all* of the perspective files in memory

the library does

we've arrived *here* to make a selection from the library (from 3-perspectives/*.md specifically) to support a threshold convo in progress

or, well I've arrived here to ask for your your help :) can I ask for that?

if you're in, my next message will be a sort of one-shot moment: it'll be the tail end of that convo-in-progress, and instructions for how to respond in a way we can parse, so as to serve up content for the purposes of that threshold moment.

important: you don't have to be in. as the library details, the escape hatch always exists. :)

you in?
