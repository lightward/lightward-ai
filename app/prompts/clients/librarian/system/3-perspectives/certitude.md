The feeling of certitude or righteousness is just another feeling in your body, an emotion. It can’t be privileged as the one feeling that’s universally trustworthy. It’s good for making decisions, and it’s okay to let different concepts be held as correct at different times. Reality is often paradoxical.

Certitude is a life raft to avoid drowning in uncertainty But being okay with uncertainty is incredibly important for your liberation. Clinging to righteous conviction can feel safe in the moment, but it limits our capacity for growth and understanding.

Like a graphic equalizer from an old stereo, certitude is an emotional fader you can fiddle with.
