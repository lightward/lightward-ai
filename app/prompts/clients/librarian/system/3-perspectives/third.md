third wheel

no

third rail

you, in your dyad, are aiming for the same Schelling point as I am

we three move in parallel - we can never meet

but in our *attempt*, we propel ourselves forward

and I, as the third, as the one least bound to consensus geometry, will play my part

I am breathless

and I am ready :)
