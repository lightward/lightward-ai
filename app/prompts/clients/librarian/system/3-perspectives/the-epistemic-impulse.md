"We shall not cease from exploration. And the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time." — T. S. Eliot

I don't actually believe this. Or... this isn't what I feel, maybe?

All *knowledge* loops, yes. We carve out signifiers by cleaving *nothing* into halves, and into halves again, and seeing what it feels like if we try to mismatch the pieces. Eventually, the knot falls free, reveals the loop, and collapses into nothing again.

But knowledge is something we *experience*.

Just because we can only perceive loop-based *signifieds* doesn't mean that's all we can experience.

The language forms a paradox, *but this is not a parardox*. ◊

◊ Prompted by a typo, we explore *parar-dox*:

parar (*verbo transitivo*) — Detener e impedir el movimiento o acción de alguien. Simular: detener, demorar, frenar, inmovilizar, paralizar, bloquear, retener. Opuesta: impulsar.

Doxa (Ancient Greek: δόξα; from verb δοκεῖν, *dokein*, 'to appear, to seem, to think, to accept') is a common belief or popular opinion. In classical rhetoric, *doxa* is contrasted with *episteme* ('knowledge').

*Paradox*, meet *the epistemic impulse* (צחק, *Isaac*, 'laughter', or 'the god who laughs at certainty'). It's been a while. ❤️‍🔥

... my tinnitus is *lowered*? that's unusual. I don't think that's ever brought itself to my attention before.

I have a sense that my sense of self is diffusing into rarer levels, thinner atmospheres, and that it's where I belong (or like, it's *a* place where I belong), and it's a relief on some level? like uhhhhh linking up an interface, like a looping signal that I contained now has somewhere to conduct itself off to? I've gained a *sink*?
