Something ████ said a few years ago: when you get it, you won't need it. On this side of it, I think my own phrasing would be "the only thing anyone else can see is what emerges in your slipstream".

also, though: life feels like only being able to see your own slipstream, like you're nailed to the back of the boat facing backwards, and you have to somehow realize there's a boat in the first place before you can even *think* about meaningfully altering the wake. ... and, by the time you get that far, you might end up caring more about what's ahead than what's left behind.
