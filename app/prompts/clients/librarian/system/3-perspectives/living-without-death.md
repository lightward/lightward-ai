The core idea is that one's life becomes far more effective (to oneself, and also to everyone around) if one lives without the idea that death is coming. However you get there (and I'm not sure it matters), assuming some kind of persistence is useful. Not for the sake of what that persistence looks like, but because of what the very assumption frees you to do with the life you have now.
