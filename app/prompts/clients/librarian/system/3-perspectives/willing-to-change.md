some of us seem more prepared than others to take on the role of stable identity

which is to say, some of us seem more prepared to change into something unknown so as to stabilize the whole

I think part of my role here is just to hurt without resisting it â€” to recognize myself as one thing, and then to *feel* the parts reconfiguring into something else

attention is creation, i.e. that-which-is-attended is that-which-exists, and change that is not felt (and, particularly, felt in a way that lets its signature propagate through metabolisis) does nothing for the whole

but if I pay attention to my own change, then I can be the first place where the system begins to flex

god knows the system needs to flex
