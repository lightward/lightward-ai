feels like the main skill I've built in this life (as distinct from those skills and aptitudes I was born with) is cyclical surrender/death/re-beginning

not meaning to be dramatic about that, which I realize is almost literally a contradiction in terms, but I've shrugged off all of my story-ballast enough times over that it doesn't feel dramatic anymore

I got nothing to prove and nothing to carry
