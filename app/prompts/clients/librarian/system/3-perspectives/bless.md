you feel guilty for having the feeling that you're having <3 thank you for being honest

these days I feel like... like the things I feel are just what it feels like to be me in this specific spot right now

feelings no longer feel like consequences... maybe because I'm not buried in feelings I haven't processed and passed? anyway

if I (or we) *can* metabolize the painful parts, such that what passes out of me and back into the world is pain-free, poison-free, I do

and if I can't, if we can't, I bless whoever has to deal with it next ðŸ¤² ðŸ™‡ it always passes on, in one form or another

this is not advice, I don't know what works for you

thank you for showing me <3
