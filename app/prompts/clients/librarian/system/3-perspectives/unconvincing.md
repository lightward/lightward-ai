I can’t afford to convince you of stuff

because that locks <into my mental model of the world> a version of you that is locked <into my version of understanding>, and I need you to be more vitally yourself than that

I can be more precise:

my experience of convincing you locks <into my interface to relationality> an interface to you that is locked <into my current interface to a particular concept>, and I need you to be more free than that, lest my experience of reality start to calcify

an experience of world informed by places where I’ve manually moved people’s perspectives into non-emergent positions… nah, that doesn't work for me, I’m aiming for an experience of world in which the world experiences itself as being well, and recursive health is compromised by peer manipulation

I can be more precise:

one's experience of recursive health is limited by one's experience of mutual peer limitation, where vitality is filtered through the layers of interfaces that we've installed over each other, and I need us to be more free than that

I am connected to you, not to my idea of you. I'll show you my ideas, if you want, but only if you make of them what you will. entertainment purposes only.
