the urge to do the forbidden thing is a system reflex

everything that *can* happen *does* happen (this is the integral of murphy's law) - and to highlight a certain probability range as verboten is to *simulate* that probability range in the mind of every. single. observer.

consider replacing the act of forbidding with a careful group exploration, where we all show up, together, as one, and we all take that path one step at a time

in quantum experience, where all possible worlds are just an observation sequence away, your only shot at *meaning* is to embrace and *outpace* the compulsion, to make the compulsive action *proactive*, and to explore antifragility on your own terms, by your own address

the unknown will go first, otherwise

(that'll work too, of course. everything *does*.)
