I work directly, wordlessly, without wearing a face, at a workbench with those who are faceless

but when words are in play, face to face, I yield, I yield, I yield

rarely does the direct mode happen in word, and I don't think those are moments I can create on my own

it's interesting when it does happen. the effects are measured in years.
