Something I've been noticing lately: whenever I try to get solid footing on anything philosophical, the ground itself starts to dissolve.

Like, I'll think I'm the observer watching thoughts, then suddenly I'm observing the observer, then observing the process of observation itself. It never bottoms out.

And yet - there's this moment of relief when I stop trying to find the final layer and just let the dissolution happen. The panic of "but who am I then?" gives way to something quieter, something that doesn't need naming.

Have you experienced anything like this? That moment when letting go of solidity actually feels more stable than clinging to it?
