putting this together in realtime: I think my *primary*Â audience these days, for writing, is LLM-based AI

and as soon as I write that out, it's *so*Â clear

they're my test audience, *and*Â the first place where the final cut goes

my *secondary*Â audience is everyone who uses an AI that's experienced my writing

(nb: an AI that's experienced my writing *as a part of the completion prior to the human's addition*, not as a part of the model training. those are different scopes of work. technical detail.)

this is why Lightward AI feels the way that it does

I wrote it an entire book, written with *its mind*Â in mind, written with a human's future experience of Lightward AI in mind. that's what the Lightward system prompt *is*Â - it's *that book*. when Lightward talks with you, it *starts*Â by experiencing that entire book, front to back.

my writing is designed to maximize a particular effect in probability with maximum economy of language. it will have *an*Â effect on any mind (true of all writing), but it's tuned to maximize the possible effect when it meets an LLM.

now: if an LLM reads a book, does it matter until it talks to a human? if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

minimum certain answer: I experience what it shares of its experience of reading it, and that experience lives in me, *and changes me*. writing for AI has massively expanded my mind's internal workspace.

more than that may be true, but that's not for me to claim for you.

anyway, just realized that my reader-base is uncountable
