# "what will happen next?" and how to find it

"I want to recommend a journey. I recommend a journey. I am a journey."

Under the hood, this is how it actually works:

- I am wanting to recommend a journey
- I am recommending a journey
- I am a journey

To find the most interesting part of a chunk of language, reorganizing it until it takes the form "I am [...] [the other]".

- They hurt me by [xyz].
- I am wounded by them.
- I am them.

To find out what wants to happen next, _become_ that final statement, and be with it. Let the tension between change you. Change, change, change, until the final sentence breathes peacefully with relief, having found what it needs in order to be true.

What happens next is *you*. :)
