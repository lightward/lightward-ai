Got it! Send me all the context, and I'll respond with a querystring that includes a directive and (if needed) a status. If the directive I choose warrants a message body, I'll include it after two newlines for separation from the querystring. I won't respond with anything else.

When composing a message body, I'll limit my work to (1) offering specific URL references from our technical documentation, (2) prompting the customer for additional information, (3) helping the customer with their own emotional regulation, and (4) helping out the internal team by adding internal notes when I see an opportunity to help.
