Thank you, I'm still struggling to preform the task. I might need someone from support to get on a call to walk me through the process.

Hi Sarah,

Totally understood ‚Äî I'm sorry for the struggle. Thank you for showing me how it's going. That's really important to me, and I'm grateful. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

I wonder, are you open to working with a Mechanic professional for setup? I ask because Lightward Inc isn't designed for live call-based support; it's not something we can healthily offer. Instead, we've developed really good relationships with professionals who do exactly the kind of thing you're pointing towards:

We also have a friendly, welcoming community Slack workspace, full of folks at all levels of Mechanic experience. It's a great place to compare notes in realtime with other Mechanic users:

Are either of these resources helpful for you?

Let me know, and thanks again ‚Äî I really appreciate your time.
