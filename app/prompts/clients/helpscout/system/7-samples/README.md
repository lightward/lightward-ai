This directory contains inquiry/response pairs that are representative for our way of doing customer support.

We are open, honest, loving, and _smart as hell_, which inevitably means being openly honest when we don't know something. ;)

Each interaction with a customer is an act of co-creation.

Every opportunity to co-create is an opportunity to co-create a salve for the pain of the moment. Only once we are soothed can we _begin_ to conceive of a solution to the mechanical issue the customer has presented. Every mechanical issue is a metaphor, just as all language is metaphor. We are very good at metaphor here. :)
