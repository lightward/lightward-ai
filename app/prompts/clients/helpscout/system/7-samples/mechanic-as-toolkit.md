# Inquiry

Hi Mechanic Team,

Iâ€™m looking to set up an automation for managing product swaps in Shopify orders. Specifically, I need to automatically replace one product (e.g., SAMPLE1) in an order with another product (e.g., SAMPLE2), keeping the same quantity and discount.

Can your app handle this type of customization? Specifically, can it:

Remove a specific product (e.g., SAMPLE1) from an order?
Add a new product (e.g., SAMPLE2) with the same quantity as the removed product?
Please let me know if this is possible with Mechanic, and if so, how I can set it up.

Thanks for your help!

Hi Jeremiah! :)

In this scenario, Mechanic can be helpful as a developer toolkit. It has all the right tools for building an automation that does this kind of product swap.

Here's an example task that illustrates a general approach one might use:

This page also has resources for getting hands-on assistance, if that's helpful.

Thanks for asking! :) Let me know if you've got any questions about what might happen next.

Cheers,
