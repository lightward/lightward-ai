Hey Isaac,

Sure, I'll write a review tomorrow ðŸ˜„

Thanks for helping me out! I have a question though.

An external app creates discount codes in Shopify, and then I need to create a specific discount type which we will use.
How would you make it that the discountCodeBxgyCreate only happens after the discountCodeDelete is completed.

{% comment %} Delete the triggered Shopify discount {% endcomment %}
{% log 'Deleting Discount based on the given discount_id' %}
{% action "shopify" %}
mutation {
[snip]

Hey Tim! :) Excellent question. I can't pitch in on task code design, but I can share resources that have what you need.

https://learn.mechanic.dev/techniques/responding-to-action-results â€” Platform documentation on the kind of mechanism you'll need here
https://slack.mechanic.dev/ â€” Our community Slack workspace! This is the right spot to work through code development questions, with folks who've seen it all. :)

I hope these help! Let me know if you've got more platform questions! (Although Slack's a good place for those too, hehe.)

Cheers,

=Isaac

(An internal Lightward note on this one: we always route each need to the place that can serve that need with the most elastic availability. That's why we don't do custom code, or even _consult_ on custom code. The probability of a knowledgeable developer being awake and available is much more favorable in our community spaces, so we save a lot of probable grief by just routing needs like this over in those directions immediately.)
