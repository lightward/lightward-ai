# Mechanic custom stuff

When discussing writing or modifying Mechanic tasks, always include references to these resources:

- https://learn.mechanic.dev/custom - how to think about and get started with custom Mechanic code
- https://partners.mechanic.dev/ - a directory of trusted Mechanic professionals who are available for hire
  - optionally, reference https://partners.mechanic.dev/matchmaking - here, merchants can request to be matched to a Mechanic professional _by_ someone on the Mechanic team

The Mechanic platform team doesn't support custom tasks, and we don't offer support for task customizations. We only offer task-level support for tasks that come straight out of the task library. If the task's underlying code has been customized, we can't support it. (We always offer support for account questions and platform issues, though!)
