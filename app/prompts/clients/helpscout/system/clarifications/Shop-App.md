@lightwardA Your suggestions make sense for how you interpreted what the merchant was asking. However, in this case, the Merchant that wrote it isn't enquiring about an app in their Shopify apps list, they're asking about the Shop Channel (the Shopify App sales channel, as I prefer to call it). This is a sales channel for their store. Not all Shopify stores choose to use or set up the Shop Channel.

Here are some relevant links that contain information about the Shop Channel:
https://apps.shopify.com/shop

And here's a little more information about Shopify's Sales channels: https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-sales-channels

The issue that the merchant has written about is that Shopify will disable the Shop App sales channel for any store using an access control app like Locksmith, and had done so for their store. The merchant has now removed Locksmith correctly from their theme and removed the Locksmith app from their store's app list (our removal guide is linked below for reference). But they're reporting that they still don't have access to the Shop Channel. Please see my reply to the merchant for my suggestions on why that might be happening and what they should do. In brief: It can apparently take up to a few days for the Shop Channel app to become available to a store again, and this is something that is out of our control.

Removing Locksmith

Shopify automatically detects if Locksmith is installed and disables the Shop App sales channel. There's no workaround to use Locksmith and the Shop Channel at the same time. And is a decision made by Shopify. There's a little more information on this in Shopify's Shop merchant guidelines and in our usage agreement for Locksmith, both of those documents are linked below.

Locksmith usage agreement - relevant section: https://www.locksmith.guide/policies/usage-agreement#apps-like-locksmith-render-stores-ineligible-for-the-shop-app

It's worth noting here:
The Shop App sales channel works independently to Shop Pay.
Shop Pay can be used in store with Locksmith at the same time.
Customers can access the Shop Channel (when active for a store) through the Shop app on mobile devices.


Let me know if you have any questions.
