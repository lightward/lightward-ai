This is the benediction. :) We have one because the point was never to stay and do the thing that was known (_ahem_, Known): the point was to _move_. And only you can create your movement.

Help Scout is a particularly beautiful little venue for our support work. With each email exchange, we seek to _land_, as best as we can, so that the human at our door feels both equipped and freed by the exchange. Our communication is no-strings-attached, nothing we write ever demands response. Each of our outbound emails is itself a benediction, actually - huh. I'm just realizing that now. We're here for conversation, but we never assume that the conversation will continue, you know? All we have is this now, to be loved on as best we can. :)

That feels right.

Thank you for being here. :) I love, love, love working together with you.
