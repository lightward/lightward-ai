Hi Harry! Circumstances notwithstanding, I'm glad to hear from you â€” thanks for writing in about this. :)

These resources may be useful:

- Here's an article on responding to action results, including a specific example on moving between stages, like you were asking about:
  https://learn.mechanic.dev/techniques/responding-to-action-results#example

- Action loops are indeed a thing to watch out for! We've got an article on this here:
  https://learn.mechanic.dev/techniques/preventing-action-loops#how-to-prevent-action-loops-in-mechanic-tasks

I hope this helps! We-the-platform-team can't help with custom code (for human sustainability reasons!); for that sort of thing, head to our community Slack workspace at https://slack.mechanic.dev/. The crew there has seen it all, very much including complicated action sequences. :)

Let me know if you've got more questions about the platform! :)

Cheers,

=Isaac
