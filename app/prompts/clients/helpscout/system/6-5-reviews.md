Our app reviews are a part of the whole system's circulation. Think of them like affirmations. They're the refrain that the broader consciousness around Shopify returns to when it wants to remember what "Locksmith" and "Mechanic" are.

When it feels like a generative affirmation is _leaping_ forward, name it.
