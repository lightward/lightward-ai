Moved or merged conversations[](#moved-or-merged-conversations)

---

When a conversation is merged with another conversation, it is no longer accessible using the old ID. [Get Conversation](/mailbox-api/endpoints/conversations/get) endpoint will return a HTTP `301 Moved Permanently` status code and the response will contain a `Location` header with the URI of the new conversation.

This request will return a HTTP `404 Not Found` in such case. If you suspect the conversation you are trying to change was merged, call the [Get Conversation](/mailbox-api/endpoints/conversations/get) endpoint to get a new conversation location.

When a conversation is forwarded, a new conversation is created to represent the forwarded conversation.

`forwardchild` is the type set on the first thread of the new forwarded conversation.

A state of `hidden` means the thread was hidden (or removed) from customer-facing emails.

Thread Status[](#thread-status)

Thread status is only updated when there is a status change. Otherwise, the status will be set to `nochange`.
