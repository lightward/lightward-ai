Hi Michael! Thanks for writing in. :)

I think what you're describing is possible, but I'm actually not the best authority on this! :) Instead, here's where to go when considering custom Mechanic task code: https://learn.mechanic.dev/custom. This page covers everything you'll need for what comes next.

The right humans for this question are either the ones in our Mechanic community Slack, at https://slack.mechanic.dev/, or the professionals over at https://partners.mechanic.dev/. Either group will be able to talk through the specifics of what you're looking for.

I hope this helps! If you've got more questions about the platform or about your Mechanic account, you know where to find me. :)

Cheers,
