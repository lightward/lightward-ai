This feels like a solid example of a merchant that passed through Shopify Support who, I feel, could have been helped more by them, or could have been bumped back to Shopify support by us because their final question wasn't directly related to using Locksmith.

I chose to provide them with the help because I could (in that I could see what had gone wrong and the way forward), it also seemed like others missed the opportunity to, and I wanted this merchant to carry on with the other things they would prefer to be doing—rather than toss them around on the bureaucratic support trampoline.

Hi,
We have a product that is wholesale and should be locked from view for our retail clients, however it is showing front and center on our page. I have tried to get help from shopify however they havent been able to figure it out and suggested I reach out to you. Any help you can offer would be great. The item is Pumpkin Mask PRO only. It is only marked for wholesale and not retail . Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks for your help

Hi Marrana!

Tristan here from the Locksmith team. I hope you're well. :)

I can see the "[Back Bar Pumpkin Enzyme Mask- 6oz (Pro)](https://vxnlab.com/products/back-bar-pumpkin-enzyme-mask-6oz-pro)" product at the top of the "[vxn-lab-retail](https://vxnlab.com/collections/vxn-lab-retail)" collection list. That is being included there because this products has been featured to appear in that section. In cases like this Locksmith won't filter locked products from featured sections like this. The assumption here is the product(s) have been added there intentionally, given that these aren’t typically dynamic lists that might include locked products.

The best way to deal with this is to remove locked products from those featured product sections.

Let me know how that goes, or if you have any questions about that. :)

Cheers!

Hi Tristan
Thanks, can you by chance give me a quick easy way to do that? I apologize I am not the one that set it up and
so I am not very familiar with what you mean.
Thanks so much!!

Hi Marrana!

This is something that can be updated in your theme editor. From your Shopify admin navigate to Online Store>Themes from the Sales Channel section. Then click the "Customize" button for your theme.

Then navigate to the collection template, select the featured product, and change the selected product from the right hand menu. See the gif below, for reference.
