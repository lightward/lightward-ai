Subject: queue is increasing

hi
the current queue is 22hours behind
earlier it was 17 hours behind.

Some important automations are not working.
What can we do to clear the queue?
I have already disabled a few tasks

Hi Jinesh,

Thanks for writing in. It's a headache, isn't it? ❤️ We're working on resolving the slowdown, and you can track our progress here:

https://status.mechanic.dev/incidents/fjk22spwhg67

And if you'd like to chat with others who are impacted, join our community Slack at https://slack.mechanic.dev/. There's a thread in #general right now about this incident.

In the meantime, I raised your Mechanic concurrency limit from 5x to 10x, which should help.

I'm sorry for the trouble — thanks for letting us know that this impacts you. You're important, and so is this. ❤️

With anticipation for a solid fix for this issue,

=Isaac
