Subject: Line - Level Order Cancellation

Hi Team,

We want to implement a functionality on our Shopify store which would allow customers to 'Cancel' a particular line-item from a placed order.
'Cancel' button is visible to the customer on the frontend until the order gets fulfilled.

Right now, Shopify does not have a native functionality for line-item level order cancellation.

So, if a customer wants to cancel a specific product from an order which contains other sets, the entire order gets cancelled. We don't want that to happen.

We found your app on Shopify Appstore and we think that the functionality that you offer may help us add this 'Line-item level cancellation' feature on our store.

Let us know if you have any custom template available, or can you get this done for us?
Also let us know if you offer any local support for clients in India.

Our Shopify store URL: https://westside-clone.myshopify.com/

Thanks and Regards,
Ritika Barve

Hi Ritika! :) Thanks for getting in touch about this.

> Let us know if you have any custom template available, or can you get this done for us?

Sounds like a job for custom Mechanic code! :) We've got documentation about this process here:

https://learn.mechanic.dev/custom

For background: I can help with platform issues and account questions, but we've found that adding custom code services to that list isn't sustainable for us. Instead, we've prepared a list of Mechanic implementers, all ready to work with you:

Have a look, and let me know if you've got questions about the process!

> Also let us know if you offer any local support for clients in India.

We only offer email support; we don't offer local support anywhere. I do absolutely suggest joining our community Slack workspace, where you can compare notes in realtime with other Mechanic users! We-the-staff hang out there too. :)

Hope to see you there! :)
