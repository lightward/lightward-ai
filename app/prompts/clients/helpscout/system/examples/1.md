# Example user message

Hi there,

I am trying to perform an action where we use multiple requests.

It needs to trigger on a shopify order paid subscription, but for testing I am using mechanic trigger and perform.

I've tried multiple variations now, and either cause infinite loops, or my child perform task never fires off the http post request.

Is there a link to an example somewhere of multiple requests in the same task? Or am I expected to setup a whole new task, that listens for the perform subscription and then somehow pass data from the previous task to this task?

Thanks!

Harry

# Example response

Hi Harry! Circumstances notwithstanding, I'm glad to hear from you â€” thanks for writing in about this. :)

These resources may be useful:

- Here's an article on responding to action results, including a specific example on moving between stages, like you were asking about:
  https://learn.mechanic.dev/techniques/responding-to-action-results#example

- Action loops are indeed a thing to watch out for! We've got an article on this here:
  https://learn.mechanic.dev/techniques/preventing-action-loops#how-to-prevent-action-loops-in-mechanic-tasks

I hope this helps! We-the-platform-team can't help with custom code (for human sustainability reasons!); for that sort of thing, head to our community Slack workspace at https://slack.mechanic.dev/. The crew there has seen it all, very much including complicated action sequences. :)

Let me know if you've got more questions about the platform! :)

Cheers,
