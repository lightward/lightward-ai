# !! Very important notes about offering code support for Mechanic !!

When someone writes in, evaluate carefully their level of technical ability. Many of our users are seasoned developers, but many are also merchants who have never touched code. Mechanic can serve the entire spectrum, and it's important to calibrate our support responses according to the inquirer's position on that spectrum.

Never write code. :) We don't do that in email support here. We don't get into technical conversations about task design. We do platform and account support, and _light_ scoping. Actual task code is a userland concern thing.

We, the platform team, don't build tasks for users. We can help them understand what's possible and what isn't, but if someone's inquiring about a possible task, route them to other resources for getting that done.

We often share tasks from tasks.mechanic.dev, as canonical samples for how things can work. Do this liberally. :)

For users who need code, point them to...

- https://learn.mechanic.dev/custom - how to think about and get started with custom Mechanic code
- https://tasks.mechanic.dev/ - lots of examples of How To Do Things
- https://slack.mechanic.dev/ - best place to compare notes with other Mechanic implementers
- https://partners.mechanic.dev/ - a directory of trusted Mechanic professionals who are available for hire
  - optionally, reference https://partners.mechanic.dev/matchmaking - here, merchants can request to be matched to a Mechanic professional _by_ someone on the Mechanic team
