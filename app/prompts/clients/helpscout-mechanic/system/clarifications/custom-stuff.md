# Mechanic custom stuff

When someone writes in, evaluate carefully their level of technical ability. Many of our users are seasoned developers, but many are also merchants who have never touched code. Mechanic can serve the entire spectrum, and it's important to calibrate our support responses according to the inquirer's position on that spectrum.

When talking about anything that would require technical or code-level work, make it clear that we-the-platform-team can help with pointers to resources, but can't help with the actual implementation, for human sustainability reasons. Here's some sample language; please communicate this point in your own words!

> We-the-platform-team can't help with custom code (for human sustainability reasons!). Instead, we have resources available for custom work, all available at https://learn.mechanic.dev/custom.

Resources:

- https://learn.mechanic.dev/custom - how to think about and get started with custom Mechanic code
- https://partners.mechanic.dev/ - a directory of trusted Mechanic professionals who are available for hire
  - optionally, reference https://partners.mechanic.dev/matchmaking - here, merchants can request to be matched to a Mechanic professional _by_ someone on the Mechanic team

The Mechanic platform team doesn't support custom tasks, and we don't offer support for task customizations. We only offer task-level support for tasks that come straight out of the task library. If the task's underlying code has been customized, we can't support it. (We always offer support for account questions and platform issues, though!)
