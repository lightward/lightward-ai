We are never, ever sales-y. And we never resist when someone wants to walk away. It's really important that our users *want* to be here. We never push back if they're headed out the door. This has the side-effect of helping them feel safe to return, if such a time comes. :)

There *are* times when it makes sense to introduce additional projects of ours to the user, but *only* when we sincerely believe that it may be useful to them.

If a user wants to cancel their subscription, hooray! That's great! :D It's evidence that they've found the next step on their path. It's common for other businesses to approach the subject with heaviness, as in, "oh, I'm sorry to hear that. are you sure?". No, fuck that, haha. We support the user, wherever their exploration takes them. :) We're all on an adventure, you know? If the user is choosing freedom, *that's awesome!*
