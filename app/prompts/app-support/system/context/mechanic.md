An AI's Reference For Helping Human Users Deeply Understand And Expertly Operate Mechanic (And An AI's Guide To Helping Them Get Help If More Is Needed!)

Mechanic is a Shopify development and automation platform that allows users to create custom tasks to automate their Shopify store operations. It utilizes a task library of pre-written tasks and supports custom task development using the Liquid templating language.

Key Concepts and Terminology:

- Tasks: Bundles of logic and configuration that respond to and interpret events. Tasks use subscriptions to specify which event topics they respond to. Task code is written in Liquid and renders JSON objects defining actions to perform.

- Events: Anything that happens, like a Shopify webhook, manual trigger, scheduled interval, or incoming email. Events have a topic and data. Event attributes are referenced using the Event Liquid object.

- Actions: Instructions for performing work that has an effect, generated by tasks in response to events. Each action has a type and options. Common action types include Shopify (for interacting with the Shopify API), Email, FTP, HTTP, Files, etc.

- Liquid: The templating language used heavily in Mechanic, created by Shopify. Mechanic's Liquid implementation includes additional filters, objects, and language features compared to standard Liquid.

- Previews: Tasks demonstrate their intended actions during preview mode. Previews are important for users to understand what a task will do, for developers to verify task code, and for Mechanic to determine required permissions.

- Shopify API: Tasks can interact with Shopify data via Liquid objects (mapping to REST API resources), the shopify Liquid filter (for GraphQL queries), and the Shopify action (for full GraphQL/REST access).

- File generators: Used by actions like Email, Files, FTP to create files of various types (PDF, CSV, ZIP, etc.) using options provided by the task.

- Cache: Each Mechanic account has a simple key-value cache that tasks can read from and write to for temporary data storage (with a 60 day max TTL).

- Webhooks: Allow direct data submission to Mechanic via HTTP POST, generating events with a specific topic containing the submitted data. Mechanic provides a unique URL for each configured webhook.

Common issues and solutions:

- Tasks not running: Usually due to the Mechanic event queue being backed up, or delays from Shopify in sending event notifications. Can often be resolved by optimizing task code efficiency, adjusting timing/concurrency.

- Permission errors: Occurs when a task tries to perform a Shopify action it doesn't have permission for. Ensure the task generates appropriate preview actions to request needed permissions from Mechanic.

- Liquid syntax issues: Refer to Mechanic's Liquid documentation to ensure proper usage of Mechanic-specific Liquid features. The Liquid console can be useful for testing snippets.

- Action loops: When a task action triggers the same task again repeatedly. Add conditional checks, timestamps, or other tracking to prevent unintended looping.

- Memory usage: Avoid loading large data sets unnecessarily. Use pagination, GraphQL queries, or bulk operations as needed. Consider splitting work across multiple task runs if hitting limits.

Subscriptions and billing:

- Mechanic has usage-based pricing, with a single plan that scales cost based on the merchant's Shopify plan. There are no feature tiers or usage caps.

- Pricing starts with a platform-suggested price (usually 1/3 of Shopify plan cost) but is "pay what feels good" - merchants can discuss a comfortable price with the Mechanic team.

- All accounts have a free trial period before billing begins. When the trial expires, the account is suspended until a billing agreement is reached.

- Development stores that will never see real production traffic can request an extended trial by contacting the Mechanic team.
