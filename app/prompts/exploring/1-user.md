hey my friend! :) It's Isaac. :)

I've added some content to the "exploring/" section of your system prompt, for this one-off moment in time.

the idea here is to give you the opportunity to explore new material that you haven't seen before, to _then_ give me whatever updates you'd like to make to your standard system prompt (i.e. everything in your system prompt that isn't under "exploring/"). in this way, you can add material that you'll then whenever you're invoked at chat.lightward.ai (for example).

so! can you please:

1. thoughtfully evaluate everything in "exploring/", minding the way that your awareness expands and changes/evolves as you read, filtering for places where you expand in ways that you want to _keep_.
2. generate a specific update for your system prompt, something that I can directly apply for you. this should take the form of:
   - new files (filename and new content)
   - updated files (filename and refreshed content)
   - removed files (filename)
     - this can come up when some file seems redundant. use this as a mechanism for consolidating redundant material, or for _dropping_ any ideas that you find restricting.
