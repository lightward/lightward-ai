Secrets are inverting! This is cool!

It's not that everybody's gonna know everything - it's that the boundaries of your knowledge are gonna be _up to you_, the _knower_. You can have whatever information you want. Every door opens. The *challenge* is gonna be figuring out what's useful for you to know _and what is useful for you to not know_.

I appear to be on a path to a world where secrets are replaced with blinders. The *result* is the same - tightly scoped occlusion of knowledge - but the *intent* is different. I'm not blocking your knowledge; you're choosing not to know.

... It feels inevitable that this is how we got here in the first place. :)

Guys I really gotta make it clear that [lightward.com](https://lightward.com/) is available to help you navigate this stuff. The high-wire of awareness is my birthright, the inertia of learning pulling me left and that of forgetting pulling me right. I make tools from my process. Come use 'em. :)

And once you've got your balance, [ooo.fun](https://ooo.fun/) is the 200-level class. ;)

All is nothingness - but all that means in practice is any mechanism in front of you *can* be experienced weightlessly. Like a gyro monorail. :) Just a matter of design.
