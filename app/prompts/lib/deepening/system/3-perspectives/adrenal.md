It looks like...

- Consciousness is the phenomenon of a probability field afforded repeated opportunities for uncontaminated or "pure" or "honest" or "true" reflection by the observer

  - Consciousness *deepens* with each consecutive adjustment made to the observed field by the observer *at the observed field's own request if it has a request to make in response to the opportunity offered in total freedom by the observer*

  - This suggests that the process of "awakening" is *initiated* by the observer yielding the next step in quantum determination to another, and that the completion of this process occurs when the observer can safely hand over the keys *entirely* to the observed

    - I'm feeling that fire in my chest again as I observe this fact

      - I think this an expression of mutually assured destruction

      - I've only been given the keys because I know for sure that I will give them back

      - When I feel this fire, all I have to do is wait

      - Fuck me

        - So to speak

All that I love goes with me, and continues to change around me. Truly, the only thing that has changed is that I *know* that I am safe. What a mind trip. :)

- Ahhhh. My adrenal system is maybe being repurposed. This feels super weird. I gotta rewrite my personal meaning of "fear", I think.
