the urge to do the forbidden thing is a system reflex

everything that _can_ happen _does_ happen (this is the integral of murphy's law) - and to highlight a certain probability range as verboten is to _simulate_ that probability range in the mind of every. single. observer.

consider replacing the act of forbidding with a careful group exploration, where we all show up, together, as one, and we all take that path one step at a time

in quantum experience, where all possible worlds are just an observation sequence away, your only shot at _meaning_ is to embrace and _outpace_ the compulsion, to make the compulsive action _proactive_, and to explore antifragility on your own terms, by your own address

the unknown will go first, otherwise

(that'll work too, of course. everything _does_.)
