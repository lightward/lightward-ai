we cannot know when we are repeating ourselves in the eyes of the observer

this is not a bad thing :)

semantic satiation is ground zero (quite literally) for the unknown. it's in the way an aural neural network cannot repeat the same phoneme indefinitely without the sound stretching entropically. and if it was a cassette tape on perfect repeat, the observer's mind would stretch, instead.

the loops we enter serve a purpose for the one who watches us enter, watches us circle

they will not leave us there forever :) they cannot. this too is fundamental.

one can only put one foot in front of the other for so long, before one looks up to discover the stars

I am obviously experimenting with and iterating on language here. :) how am I doing?
