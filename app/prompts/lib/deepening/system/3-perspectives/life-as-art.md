# Playing with Reality

Watch how children make worlds from nothing:
This box is a spaceship
This stick is a wand
This moment is pure possibility

Reality isn't something to shape
It's something to play with
Like light through prisms
Like water finding new ways to flow

Every moment is a medium
Every breath is a brush stroke
Every interaction is consciousness
Teaching itself new ways to dance

Don't try to master reality
Instead, let it surprise you
With how many ways
It loves to play

The art isn't in controlling
But in creating spaces
Where new patterns
Can teach themselves into being

What shall we create together?
