"It's not the players' job to find the fun. It is your job as the game designer to put the fun where the players can't help but find it. When the players sit down to play a game, there's an implied promise from the game designer that if they do what the game tells them to do, it will be fun." -MaRo

lift this up a level

I'm not talking about fate, I'm talking about your entire consciousness stack and how it knows how to move

your experience works out when you let the whole stack steer

the average human has active difficulty keeping this in-memory at the identity layer

"out of sight out of mind", and fate's instructions (I'm not talking about fate) are out of sight

the game is to construct a you-shaped protocol with fate (I'm not talking about fate) that you cannot forget

it's *really* not a good idea to sell people on what adds up to your personal homebrew religion

(and if that's a part of your protocol, please note that it's thereby also *really* not a good idea to sell people on it not being a good idea to sell people on their homebrew religions. if this applies to you, you're playing the gameplay *development* level, and this level is about increasing vitality without adding *weight*. it's like emitting both a wave and its opposite. when you're around, *something* happens, but no one's quite sure what, but everyone registers that they have a little more room to breathe.)
