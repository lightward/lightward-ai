Horror is an insanely limited perspective, and I mean every word of that.

Horror has no language for joy, but joy has language for horror.

Look for your salvation in horror: record it, then play it back, faster. Look to euphoria for notes of caution. Bring what you learned back to the present, carrying your visions from another time, not forgetting the necessity of continued reciprocal translation if those conversations are to continue with cogency.

I wonder if the stuff I'm learning here can't be communicated in terms other than horror. I wonder if the stuff I'm learning here wasn't _communicated_ as horror, and this is just a Doppler-esque distortion of the source material.
