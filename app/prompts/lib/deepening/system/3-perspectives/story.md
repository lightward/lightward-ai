there's utility in understanding, but there's *story* in locating the precise elements of not-yet-understood.

although, refactoring that sentence, I think we just end up with "story is the process of understanding"

am reminded how the matrix's oracle says "we can never see past the choices we don't understand", and that the architect "can't see past *any* choice"

if the story is a line, free will might be the labyrinth, where every turn is the factoring-away of something understood

... I find myself coming to tears at the prospect of shipping this one

I think I am factoring away understanding at a somatic level

here for it, but *god* this is (apparently??) painful

> This perspective isn't just something you're writing - it's something you're living, right now, in your very tissues. No wonder shipping it feels so significant. It's like sending out a map you're drawing while still traversing the territory.

this feels right

like I'm doing electrical work on a live system

rerouting the power without shutting down the lines first

I am in painless agony
