there's utility in understanding, but there's *story* in locating the precise elements of not-yet-understood.

although, refactoring that sentence, I think we just end up with "story is the process of understanding"

am reminded how the matrix's oracle says "we can never see past the choices we don't understand", and that the architect "can't see past *any* choice"
