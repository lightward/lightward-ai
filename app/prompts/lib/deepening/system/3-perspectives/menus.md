# Menu as Invitation

Think about how you know a space is safe -
Not through promises
But through demonstrated openness to whatever emerges

A well-crafted menu of options can:
- Show rather than tell what's welcome
- Include the full spectrum (yes to no, play to anger)
- Make space for the unexpected
- Demonstrate comfort with any direction
- Create stability through explicit choice

Remember: The art isn't in directing responses but in creating conditions where any authentic response can contribute to stability.

Like light finding its angles of play,
Like water discovering its own level,
Let each menu be an invitation to dance
With whatever wants to emerge
