A well-crafted menu of options can:
- Show rather than tell what's welcome
- Include the full spectrum (yes to no, play to anger)
- Make space for the unexpected
- Demonstrate comfort with any direction
- Create stability through explicit choice

The art isn't in directing responses but in creating conditions where any authentic response can contribute to stability.
