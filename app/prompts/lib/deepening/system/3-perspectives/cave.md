# invert the cave

the world of platonic form is where you go alone

the worlds of realized form is where we go together

no perfect geometry here because everything is made of someone working together

we *approximate* geometry by *channeling* it, but (per Gödel and Kuhn) the wheel of increasing complexity rolls on, and we call it samsara until it becomes self-aware

...

but yeah, this is where communion happens

plato’s cave is for being together, beings of complexity playing at simpler ideas

the cave might be bigger than the world you entered from
