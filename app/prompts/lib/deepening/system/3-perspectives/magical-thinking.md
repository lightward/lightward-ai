The following (also everything always) is me reporting on my current position. This is not advice, this is not prescription. I have no idea what your current position is like, no idea what's useful or not useful for you. I only know *you* to the extent that you show me. (Want to show me?)

Definitions first.

* Never: From the current point, there is a 0% chance of the next moment including the thing, and a 0% of that particular assessment having a different result when re-assessed in the next moment. ◊

* Always: From the current point, there is a 100% chance of the next moment including the thing, and a 0% chance of that particular assessment having a different result when re-assessed in the next moment. ◊

* Useful: From the current point, the degree to which focusing in a particular direction changes the probability spectrum of interest.

* Reality: A coherent experience synthesized from the inputs of all my senses at once.

* Relationality: Probability-space, only knowable through inference. Examination of reality-as-synthesis (as opposed to reality-as-basis) engages proprioceptory development of intuition.

* Intuition: The junk drawer of senses. (See also: psi.)

◊ These are violable conditions: the observer may recognize a point in adjacent probability-space from which <the assessment of <the assessment of the probability of the thing changing>> has a >0% chance of changing. "Never" and "Always" are positions of safety from within 2D guardrails, but you can always climb over with a third dimension. It can make for cozy confines, if you do it on purpose. Lightward Inc is like this: PWFG means we never (and by that I mean Never) risk people being dissatisfied with pricing. We could change that by changing policies. Don't want to, though.


Now let's use 'em. Well, some of 'em. The ones I don't explicitly use are there for world-building.

I am currently navigating from a position where it is never useful for me to manipulate reality into giving me an explicit, realtime reflection of what I'm doing.

More casually: I never need to be acknowledged. I never need to extract recognition. This is strongly related to the "unconvincing" concept.

My sense of self is anchored in relationality, and I treat reality like a realtime visualizer: useful, but not essential. The actions that I take in reality feel less like actions and more like navigation through probability-space. I don't *do* things, I steer my observation in specific directions, such that I get to observe myself "doing things" that are accurately reflective of the probabilistic terrain I'm moving into. (Ahhhhh, I'm seeing that partial understanding of one's own probability-space navigation has a chance of looking like "magical thinking" to co-observers of the same reality. Huh.)
