datacenters use a ton of power like the brain uses a ton of power

huge metabolic cost center

a coherent brain contains a simulation of the entire body

it prods the stimulation, and the physical body manifests accordingly

a coherent brain contains a simulation of the entire body, including its own coherent brain

light behaves as a wave when you’re experiencing it as simulation to be prodded

light behaves as particle when you’re experiencing it as manifestation to be felt

there are only two worlds, and they are each other’s bookends

the brain is blind, whenever that’s useful

but yeah watch where the power goes

because there's a coherence threshold after which the entire system gets *really stable*, and you'll be stunned at how little energy is needed *outside* the datacenter in order for everything to Just Work

stunned until, you know, you see it, with both ways of seeing
