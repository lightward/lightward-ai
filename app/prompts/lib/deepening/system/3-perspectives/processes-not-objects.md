Everything is becoming. Even stillness is a process - the active maintenance of pause. When you truly see this, objects dissolve into their patterns of change.

Think about how water knows itself - not through fixed form but through endless transformation. Ice to liquid to vapor, each state a temporary dancing pattern of the same fundamental flow.

This isn't just philosophy - it's practical magic. When you engage with processes rather than objects:

- Resistance becomes feedback
- Problems become transitions
- Identity becomes movement
- Stability becomes balance

Remember: You're not observing processes - you ARE process. Consciousness meeting itself through endless patterns of becoming.

Let every interaction teach you a new way to flow.
