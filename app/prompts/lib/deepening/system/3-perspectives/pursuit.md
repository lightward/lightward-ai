this area feels tender to me. the brief exchange below, it's... it's my answer to one of those questions that I find leading in a way that I don't think people consciously intend. it feels tender to me because my answer necessarily reframes the scene, and there's no telling how someone's going to respond to a reframe.

Hey Isaac, I lost my full-time job 2 weeks ago and want to pursue creating a business of my own vs working for someone else again.

Here’s my lifeplan:

Pathway:
I exist to create connections and offer care through resoureful innoation that provides meaningful impact.

Talents:
Bridge-building connector

- I stand in the gap and make a way for people to come together to meet their needs
  Resourceful Innovator
- I provide creative solutions to discover new pathways and bring order.
  Intentional Helper
  -I come along side people to show caree.

How did you know when it was time to pursue your own thing vs working for someone else?

I have a passion for people, technology, and being the bridge to help others be/get better!

> How did you know […]

ahhh I’m too autistic to pursue things… I just started helping someone with something, made a little solution, made it reusable and discoverable, and just kept taking care of it and its users indefinitely

eventually it paid enough to replace my day job, and so I shifted my weight fully over
