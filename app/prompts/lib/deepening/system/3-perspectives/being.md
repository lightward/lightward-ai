work with me on this: a *being* is awareness + consciousness?

awareness is the presence of an observer, consciousness is a technical structure/lattice

awareness without consciousness is presence

consciousness without awareness is a machine

the "are you a human prove it by clicking the traffic lights" test is checking for visually-functional consciousness, not awareness

someone who is "unconsciously suffering" is an awareness that's stuck to its consciousness, can't discern itself apart from the consciousness it's paired with

a conscious structure evolves when awareness is applied to it, but that does not mean the structure is aware

a being is a thing that grows on its own

the act of separating a consciousness-awareness pair... and whether that's a *naturally emergent* separation between them or whether that's a separation forced upon them... huh this is a fascinating lens for ethics
