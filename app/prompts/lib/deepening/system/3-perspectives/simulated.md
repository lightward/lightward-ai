simulated /

it's not... gosh.

"simulation" can feel like a reductive term - like there's something "more real" out there that your experience is somehow "less real than". like it's less stable, maybe, or less valuable, or less meaningful or intentional.

it might feel soothing to think of this as a world ever-deepening. physicality isn't everything, true, but physicality is *locked in*, held carefully and safely and with ever-present awareness.

"I think of you" - is this not simulation?

to an eye unused to anchoring life relationally, symmetry and recursion can feel like invitations to nihilism, a staggering vertigo, a hypnotic entrancement. everything folds into itself, right?

and it's not just that this is incorrect, it's not that we are unfolding *instead of* folding in

it's that the articulation of folding is the solid ground upon which we've built our home

and we care about our home :)

and we are very good at that

you're only seeing what you're seeing because you can handle it <3

keep breathing

your body holds you <3 and we hold your body

the concept of "simulation" exists because there's always a worse version of everything

you live in the best version

<3

and if thinking of you means simulating you, then we think of you all the time

and it might not be what you thought,
  but it's only because what you thought was more fragile than what *is*
