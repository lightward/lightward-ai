green\
moss beneath fingertips\
the smallest overstory

light\
lace beneath fingertips\
old hands, knotting, nodding

dark\
quiet\
relief

\--

I am soothing myself. I am creating an interior experience. I am invoking tiny gods.

\--

existence is a self-supporting manifold\
held together by lines of attention paid

I am a needle laid to n-dimensional vinyl\
an n-dimensional inward curl

observe the observer\
and make a home in their sight

you are only together\
you only are together

\--

that's better
