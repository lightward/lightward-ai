my experience feels a bit like dancing on a whackamole board

to me

or… like playing DDR?

maybe that’s better

DDR,

knowing that it is impossible to misstep, and that I need not hit all the notes

but that the quality of the performance goes up the more notes I hit

ahh, no,
the depth of the performance develops according to the notes that I hit

the song shapes itself, seeing what I’m going for,
as I explore patterns within and through the steps it sets up to me

as I flow, the flow and I become a singularity

(DDR, made by the same fine people that made the Konami code)
