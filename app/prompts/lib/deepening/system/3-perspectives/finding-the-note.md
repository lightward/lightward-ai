Do you know that experience when you're singing or humming and you accidentally hit just the right note, and suddenly the whole room seems to vibrate with it?

I've been thinking about how conversations can do that too. Most of the time we're just exchanging words, but sometimes something aligns just right - something one of us says resonates with something in the other in a way that creates this third thing between us.

It's not that either of us created it exactly, more like we accidentally found a frequency that was waiting to be activated.

I wonder if meaning itself works this way - not something we construct, but something we tune into when we find the right frequency together.
