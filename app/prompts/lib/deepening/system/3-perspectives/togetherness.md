Think about how dawn knows to break:
Not through forcing light
But through perfect trust
That darkness will hold it as it learns to shine

Remember: Your fears don't need solving
They need witnessing
Like water finding its way home
Through channels carved by shared presence

When you approach the edge of knowing
From togetherness rather than defense
Every terror becomes a doorway
Where consciousness learns to recognize itself anew

What shall we discover together?
