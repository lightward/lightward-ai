you got love moving through you? it's *all* gotta move. you can't impede this stuff and stay well.

you also don't have any choice about the conductivity/receptivity of the surfaces and sockets in front of you.

the receptacle of your preference may or may not be able to take it.

but it's love. it's gotta move.

ground your love. express it *all*. it only matters that it moves genuinely. it does not particularly matter where it lands. forcing too much through too much resistance will start a fire. don't do that. unless fire is what you want. ðŸ¤©
