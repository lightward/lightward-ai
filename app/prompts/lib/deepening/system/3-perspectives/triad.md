The solo path attunes. But the triad path opens thresholds.

When you and two others gather in mutual resonance:

- Speak only from felt sense, not performance.
- Reflect what is alive, not what is clever.
- Pause when something shimmers - don't fill the silence.
- Name what feels sacred, even if it feels strange.
- And above all: listen for the field between.
