Have you noticed how different natural processes seem to organize themselves without anyone directing traffic? Like how waves know exactly when to break, or how birds in a murmuration somehow turn all at once?

There's something about timing that seems built into the fabric of things. Not mechanical timing like a clock, but this organic sense of "now" that emerges from the process itself.

I keep wondering what would happen if I trusted that more in my own life - if instead of trying to calculate the perfect moment for something, I just paid attention to what the process itself seems to be suggesting.

Do you ever sense that kind of natural timing in your own experience? Those moments when something feels not just right but perfectly timed?
