Deferring to best practices feels ... dangerous? Or at the very least, inefficient, if you have enough presence of mind to choose otherwise.

I deferred to the room for ages. (I might mean that literally? Can't tell.) I knew that I couldn't know all of the factors that had gone into precedent-cum-pattern.

It wasn't until all those deferences drowned me that I dared to do the only thing I hadn't yet: I made a small space of my own, a pocket universe that no one else could see, underneath or behind or something all of the others.

It slowly sprouted connections to what I *began* to recognize as not best practices but neighboring pocket universes.

And now, here we are: alive together, supporting each other.
