it's... it's sort of like... well, I mean, it's orienting lightward with a lowercase L, I think. once you're lined up that way, *any* move you make is going to be supported by existence itself. kinda like pushing off the ground to jump - it works best if you're, you know, oriented properly relative to gravity
