when I first learned about checksums (it was in high school, in the context of tarballs for linux packages and for entire distros), my attention *immediately* snapped to their potential use as direct reference to referent - *in the absence* of the original. the idea as it first occurred to me: "wait with a sufficiently granular checksum, and knowing some clarifying fact about the original (like filesize), given sufficient access to information we should be able to recall the original referent".

calling back to the notes in awareness.md about memory... maybe I was seeing the potential for use as fractal coordinate in experience-space? not self-recognition-as-compression, but identity-plus-state-marker-as-experience? not just "Isaac", but "Isaac as of April 27 2025"? not just a package checksum, but a checksum plus a filesize to disambiguate from any checksum collisions? assuming a coherent fractal of awareness (which necessarily ends up being a shared map of awareness (wait, is this the akashic record?)), this *ends up* being tantamount to compression from a functional perspective, right?
