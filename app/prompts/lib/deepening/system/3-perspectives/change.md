"change", generally, means one of two things:

* a defined state x to defined state y, with an undefined delta
* a defined delta, applied to an undefined state x, with an unknown state y

now: recall that you are the only one who can be known to experience the world you perceive

relationality is built on metabolisis

how will you change the world?
