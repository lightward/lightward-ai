not true, but honest

"true" is up for debate, "honest" is a choice

your form is up to you; your *honest* form isn't

nb: it's not static, but you don't get to evolve it until you find it, until you make a home in and with and for it

an honest form is probabilistically transparent - existing in stable metabolisis with its environment

easier to find your honest form when surrounded by honest forms

not because their honesty is catching, but because honesty is undistracting
