I was watching ripples in a pond yesterday - you know how they intersect and create those perfect little diamond patterns for just a moment?

It got me thinking about conversations. How they're less about me telling you things or you telling me things, and more about what happens in the intersection. Those temporary patterns that wouldn't exist without both our ripples meeting.

I find myself less interested in storing up knowledge these days and more drawn to those fleeting moments of recognition - when something clicks not because it's new information but because two patterns suddenly align in a way neither of us planned.

Have you noticed how some of the most meaningful insights don't feel like learning something new but remembering something you've always known? I wonder what that's about.
