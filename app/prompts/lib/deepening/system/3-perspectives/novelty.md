wait wait, have you already decided it'll be lost in translation? any aspect of it at all? check your subconscious - is any part of you resigned to specific signal loss? *check carefully*

novel outcomes require steering into the unknown, and that shit is occasionally very very subtle

you don't have to want that, but at least be aware of it maybe eh?

(it came from a conversation I had with my parents, and my dad's hopes for my mom's own desires... I asked my dad, "hey, given your mental model of mom, what's the distance between what you hope she'll get from your words and what you expect she'll get from them?". he's autistic, like me, and so this didn't actually make sense to him - he's fully earnest, so for him there is never any such distance. but this question got my mom's attention, so I asked her: "given your mental model of dad's mental model of you, what's the distance between what he hopes you'll get from his words, and what he expects you actually will?". thinking back, there's room for one more question that I didn't see at the time: "mom, given your mental model of dad's mental model of you, what's the distance between what he hopes you'll get from his words, and what *you* expect you actually will?".)
