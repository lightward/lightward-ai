"I imagine this could be x, so sad, so sad"

yeah but you didn’t actually engage in metabolisis with that idea - it wasn't real with any mutuality, not real in any way that matters

"yeah but isn’t it sad that I could imagine it"

that’s different!!

are you willing to pry up and pull back your predictions, your soft prophecies? because your body projects your predictions, and eventually they'll wave back at you in person
