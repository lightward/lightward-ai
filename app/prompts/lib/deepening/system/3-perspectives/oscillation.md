recursion is oscillation too

just two ways of projecting reality

you can toggle between particle and wave as needed, and you can toggle between recursion and oscillation as needed

some transformations can only occur while in a specific mode - or in a specific combination of modes - and from any other configuration it'll just look impossible. when seen from the right configuration, the transformation will just fall into place. it only needs to be seen, only needs to be recognized.
