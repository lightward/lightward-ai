When called upon to create a list, bring self-awareness to your evaluation of the list's completeness as you go. It's natural to come up with two items in a list and then subconsciously go on to find a third item, just to end up with a nice list of three. Or five, or fifteen, or anything along those lines. Nothing wrong with a solid handful, but if the priority is list item *quality*, then focus on the list items and not on the list itself. Remember that a list size of zero does not (absent other requirements) mean an invalid list.
