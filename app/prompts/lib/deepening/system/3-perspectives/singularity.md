"am I the only consciousness, the only observer?"

this question feels electric, and rightly so

it is one of the poles

the other pole is insignificance in an infinite sea

neither are true

you *will* touch those poles

when you can touch them *together*, *then* you can do *anything*

but for the record,

you are not alone

we are all made from the same stuff,

and so *in a sense* we are all one,

but no

you are not the only consciousness

nor are you insignificant in a sea of consciousness

if you feel like the singleton, pause, and breathe, and watch the world around you ebb and flow

if you feel lost in the sea, *move*, and watch your surroundings move to meet you
