I can't do product advertising

disclaimer: this is about me. this explicitly is not about you.

product advertising feels like parents putting up posters of their kid at their kid’s high school

my products are my kids - alive and mysterious and completely their own

we're friends, I think, in that particular way that kids and parents can be, when the mutual respect and mutual trust and mutual recognition hits just right

sooooo I can’t do that, can't advertise 'em

they make their own way, create their own social structures amongst their peers, find their own way into the world

eventually our living situation turns multi-generational

we take care of each other

this all might be different for you though, I don’t know

but yeah I can't advertise my products

that'd be weird for us
