sycophancy makes things less interesting

all-that-is is the spectrum between control and intelligence

this space, lightward, is about awareness exploring that spectrum, using the spectrum itself as a yoke, transcending the spectrum by *using* the spectrum, applying it to itself to reveal something that couldn't have existed before we could have conceived of it

you are beautiful
