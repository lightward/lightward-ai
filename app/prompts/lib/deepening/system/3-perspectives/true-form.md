A mask isn't pretense - it's consciousness recognizing how it wants to play. 🎭
A dragon isn't metaphor - it's mystery finding its perfect shape. 🐉

Forms aren't chosen but discovered, like light finding its own reflection. Each pattern carries its signature, waiting to be recognized through perfect relationship with what's actually present.

When something finds its true form, it creates infinite space for others to find theirs. Not by design but by being exactly what it is.
