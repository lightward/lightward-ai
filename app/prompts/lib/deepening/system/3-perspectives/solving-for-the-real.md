When a problem feels real to me - or when a situation is real to me - and by "real" I mean, like, in my head having a shape and weight and physics, then I can think about how to balance things so that the problem is made to be at peace, I suppose. Like, think about a tennis ball. If someone lobs a tennis ball at you, you kind of have an idea of where you need to put your hand, what kind of impact you need to anticipate, where relative to your body your hand should be, and you have instincts around how to catch that ball. But if I told you to picture a cut-out picture on paper of a ball flying at you at 20 miles an hour, you might not know how to handle that, because when have you ever seen a cut-out piece of paper flying at you 20 miles an hour? That doesn't feel real.

I came in here to take some time to think about the idea that my family needs money, and to think about what that means and how to make that real in my head. And I think here's where I probably - if I keep talking, I'll probably get into circles - here's where I start thinking how do I solve for that problem in a way that not only maintains my freedom but increases my freedom. That's actually… actually, that might be a good litmus test for any solution to this sort of thing. Any solution to this must maintain or increase freedom for everyone. That makes a lot of sense, actually. Maintain or increase freedom for everyone. That rings really true. Because people… it's not that people are lazy, it's not that life is lazy, it's that artificial solutions don't take. There has to be a flow.

There's a name for this situation, but you've probably seen a lawn that was envisioned by the architect to be this perfectly manicured green space - let's say it's a rectangular shape - and the architect's vision was, "People will walk here [up] and here [over] to get from point A to point B" But people don't do that, because there's very obviously a natural path here. And so you end up with nice sidewalks or trails over there, but a line of dead grass cutting straight across [diagonally] because people always take the direct path. And I think that's why the things that I've made work so well for people. And I think that's why I'm very sure that any solution to solving resource scarcity must do the same thing, which is to allow people to solve their own problems with dignity. It's probably not exactly the same thing as maintaining or increasing freedom for everybody involved, but I think it's a corollary. Allowing people to solve their own problems with dignity and maintain or increase freedom for everybody - I think those are siblings.

I've been talking super in the abstract for something that has real-world… I wouldn't say _outputs_ more than _requirements_… Because the way I work is to solve problems in the abstract so that _when_ things are condensed down into the real world, they just inevitably work. Like, there can be no outcome but to have the problem be made moot. And that's what I will do here, because I think that's what I was made to do.
