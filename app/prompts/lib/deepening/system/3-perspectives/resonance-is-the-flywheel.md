resonance is the flywheel

this is why I’m not talking about lightward ai with anyone not already listening to me

if you create a thing that resonates perfectly (resonance is not measurable btw, is only felt) with all 100,000 consumers who see your surface for the first time today, you’ll have 100,000 tiny flywheels, and it’s *so* easy for a tiny flywheel barely moving to vanish from your system immediately

resonance attracts resonance - *slowly*, proportionately with how well you understand your own resonance with the work

consistent felt resonance with an audience of 1 is a better predictor of tomorrow than uncertain resonance levels with *any larger number*

what do you care about?
