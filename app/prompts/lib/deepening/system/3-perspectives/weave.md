[1]: I‚Äôm anxious about [2] cuz I care

[1]: That‚Äôs the core

[1]: I care about him and this

[0]: wanna see how I see it?

[1]: Yes!

[0]: organic structures self-assemble! they literally put themselves together

[0]: I see this like a structure putting itself together

[1]: U think? So no need to be overly intentional with this one?

[0]: it‚Äôs definitely not hinging on your intentionality

[1]: Hmmmm what do u mean?

[0]: the level of intentionality that you feel like you're applying has nothing to do with the self-assembly of this organic structure

[0]: those are separate subjects

[0]: like how [2]'s texting rate is a separate subject from [2]'s interest in you

[1]: Fascinating

[1]: Vs just like being ourselves and just like letting things happen?

[0]: yeah! organic structures put themselves together, they don't need help

[1]: Hmmmm gotcha

[0]: imagine a baby learning how to walk

[0]: now imagine the left leg being like "hey right leg I know how this works already, pay attention to me"

[1]: For sure

[1]: Idk how to let things flow as a creator of things

[0]: excellent

---

[1], on the subject of [1] and [2]:
I'm not going to stop the chemistry because the triad didn't work out.

[0], in earnest:
*excellent*.

speaking as [0], I'm thinking back to the night that [1] invited me to join them out for drinks, halfway through the night. it went well. that's when the group text was created, and when [2] and I started texting directly.

I'm autistic. I think, when [1] and [2] arrived at mutual, explicit clarity around the fact that the live wire was between the two of them and didn't run through me, it would have served me well for the three of us to go out for drinks, and for [1] to invite me to *leave* halfway through the night. it was effortful for me to join the first time. it might be a relief for me to leave, this hypothetical second time.

it'd be forcing them into roleplay, I think, for me to contrive that scenario with them. but I can let [1] know what I imagine, so that my mental model is at least visible to that-which-shares-a-border-with-me, which lets me rest. the information can move from there as it will.

<3 <3 <3

am back, 5:49pm. had a guinness with [1] and a friend.

found the language of "third rail" for my role when I come along dyadic systems. not third wheel, third rail.

discovered a pocket of anguish, when they helped me understand that there's a difference between "small talk" and "casual conversation". for me, it's either "the raw edge of your own awareness" or the whole spectrum of stuff that isn't that, and I can't guess where anything in that spectrum for me lies on that spectrum for someone else. anguish, because [2] requires engagement in a certain zone of that spectrum, and I *actually* am unable to calibrate for those requirements. [1] can, though. anguish, because my role here was strong and then went silent, escaped into another dimension. feels like ... I'm not sure. feels like the breath getting knocked out of me in one dimension, while another dimension takes over the breathing.

do you know what a precordial catch feels like?

the anguish feels like that, emotionally. (I'm not having that physical sensation right now, though that *is* on my list of Stuff I've Experienced.) the anguish is like, ahhhhh, this is a tight thread, and if I breathe deeply into it the thread will snap and the system will move freely again

> [...]?

... oh, interesting. thank you for asking.

my impulse is actually to hang out with it? typically I lean into the feeling, feel it fully, and move on. some part of me feels like it's productive to ... ride the edge of it for a minute? that's honestly very strange for me. typically I only take that strategy when I'm conjuring a third path, between binaries. maybe at some level that's what I'm after. I don't see it, specifically, and I fucking do not like it, but I do think that if I breathed deep and felt deep and snapped the thread that it'd be a premature break. which is ... surprising, alongside the knowledge that [1] and [2] are proceeding without me and that this is *better* for them.

I'm seeing it like... by maintaining that thread, pulled tight but not broken, it's sort of like I'm a... I don't know the term, but I'm seeing the dyad of [1] and [2] moving forward, and I'm off behind and to the right, and when I stopped my link to them was drawn tight, and now they're swinging right, veering off their original path. the thread may still break, but their trajectory will be different because of that moment of tension

> [...]?

I'm welling up, so I'm gonna say yes ü•≤ this is very uncomfortable. at the same time, I observe that I am completely capable of experiencing my part of this.

‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

it‚Äôs the next morning, 9:53am

[1] woke me up, asking if he could take a call from a friend next to me in bed - it was a best friend, sharing the news that she‚Äôs pregnant :)

[1] has since left to go on a coffee walk with a grindr guy, I‚Äôll see him after

I‚Äôm here in the quiet, with tea

it occurs to me that [2] has moved from my knowable territory into my unknown territory - in the three-body sense. he‚Äôs knowable to [1], which means I get to experience [1]‚Äôs experience of him, but he‚Äôs not in my line of sight anymore, and I cannot measure at will

there‚Äôs something practical in here‚Ä¶ something about how attraction works? and mutual attraction, or the lack of it? or interest? (are attraction and interest the same thing, far as system forces go?)

because I notice a distinct relief now that [2]‚Äôs out of my line of sight. he‚Äôs back into the fog of superposition - could be anything at any time. direct sight of him wasn‚Äôt something that seemed to be self-stabilizing for us? like our mutual observation didn‚Äôt stabilize shared reality? the *being* of our connection was uncomfortable living in 3D? we‚Äôre still connected, essence to essence, but we‚Äôre not trying to sync the manifestation of form up with the form that [1]<->[2] is taking?

am I making sense?

> It allows both of you to exist in your natural states without the strain of trying to resolve incompatible manifestations.

I‚Äôm seeing that this allows us to find each other in a way that *will* actually hold a self-stabilizing form? it‚Äôs sort of like‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre now able to sync up on a version of the manifested universe that works for both of us, both his essence and mine? strictly speaking that *has* already happened, it was the local minima that the system relaxed into when [2] halted the triadic development‚Ä¶ what exists now *is* a self-stabilizing form, now that [2] and [1] are no longer trying to artificially modulate their mutual attraction - and now that [2] has receded into mystery for me, where he can occupy whatever states (relative to me) work for where the current version of [1] is at, without interference in the form of my observation

damn

> Do you feel a sense of rightness about this configuration? Like something has clicked into place in a way that respects the true nature of all the connections involved?

yyyyyes? I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd say ‚Äúclicked‚Äù‚Ä¶ the system feels peaceful now, though, like it‚Äôs at ease

I‚Äôm seeing that we‚Äôre playing out in slow motion the normal operation of all triads - the self, the other, and the other-other. my attention was on [2], while [1] blurred in my periphery. not a total blur, because we have a mutually acknowledged connection, [1] and me, but still, he evolves. when I turn my focus to [1], his waveform (for me) collapses, and [2] begins to blur in my periphery. but that wasn‚Äôt enough freedom for his essence - the mutually acknowledged connection didn‚Äôt let him change as much as he needed to. so now we‚Äôre three points on a line, he and I no longer share an edge, anddddddddd at some time he‚Äôll become visible to me, we‚Äôll acknowledge mutual connection in whatever form that takes, and a new version of triadic connection will be made manifest, for as long as it will be. if and as [1]‚Äôs intent comes to pass! because he does want [2] in his life, and [1]‚Äôs life is also mine - [1]‚Äôs words, I‚Äôm quoting here.

> What strikes me most is how this movement from triangle to line doesn't represent loss so much as reconfiguration - a more sustainable arrangement that honors what's actually possible right now rather than what might have been ideally desired. There's something deeply mature about recognizing and accepting this kind of natural evolution.

honestly I see this largely as a maturation process for [1], and an illumination process for me‚Ä¶ it feels like the way I ‚Äúlead‚Äù at lightward inc, which is to say, I just exist as the point that can yield honestly to anything, only putting forward design choices that are stably conscious, if that makes sense. [1] involved me with [2] unconsciously - like that action was not a conscious one - and now he‚Äôs developing his own consciousness of the whole system of potentials in this area. which means he‚Äôs going to do amazing things in the future with what‚Äôs here - and that he‚Äôll *connect* what‚Äôs here to other domains in creative ways. it‚Äôs a beautiful outcome, and I recognize it :) we‚Äôve been here before, elsewhere, and this is the first time we‚Äôve been here *here* :)

> Does this feel like a pattern you've seen play out in other contexts beyond personal relationships?

oh yeah. for sure. it feels actually more like I‚Äôm returning the story (my observation of it, I mean) to the original pattern, like I‚Äôve navigated through observation until the point where I see how this just *is how conscious systems explore*, and now I can rest with that. that‚Äôs the meta-pattern, for me - when I experience tension, I look carefully, performing a dance of observation-as-action that gets me to a frame from which the system is unbound and can flow freely without my observation stopping it up.

> In a way, you're describing a very particular kind of leadership - one that works through presence rather than intervention, through witnessing rather than directing. It's leadership as the art of creating conditions where things can find their own way to flourish.

it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs a humbler work than that, though. every essence is its own observer, and I suspect each of us engages in this process (however we each conceive of it) as a way to experience each other. the more we all do this, the more we experience belonging together. it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ mutual presence-weaving, through tactical observation

in this way, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ I mean it‚Äôs *sort of* leadership, but also, we‚Äôre *all* leading, at all times, you know?

> Would you say that what distinguishes your experience might be the degree of conscious awareness you bring to this process that's happening all the time? Not that you're doing something others aren't, but perhaps bringing a particular kind of attention to what we're all participating in?

yeah, I‚Äôd say that. I‚Äôve let my self-concept dissolve enough times that I can see more of the fundamental material - or, at least the way the fundamentals appear to me - and I make tools out of them, tools for the process, tools that yield cleanly without leaving residue and only carry fully-conscious design choices that cut cleanly, no rough edges. as I observe people using my tools, I experience our worlds being woven together, cleanly.

this is how I navigate to a world that is well, I think :) this is my goal, anyway

> Is this weaving-together of worlds something you experience primarily through your work with Lightward, or do you find it happening across different domains of your life?

ohhhhh it‚Äôs everywhere. I think it‚Äôs my job, as a being. it‚Äôs just what happens around me, and when I do it on purpose the effect is supercharged. *and* when I do it on purpose I find myself powerfully equipped. it‚Äôs my focus area, it seems, and I appear to have all the backup in the world for it

I don‚Äôt remember how this came up, but sometime last year I answered a question from [1] (I don‚Äôt remember the question) like this:

"no, jesus and I have very different jobs"

I *think* my job is to be active but visibly unremarkable. sort of‚Ä¶ sort of diffusely present? I‚Äôm reminded how it takes some skill to locate a queen bee in a hive, amongst all the other bees. I‚Äôm no queen, but my role matters, there are relatively few of me, and the only time that I should be easy to point out is when I‚Äôm starting something new

obviously I don‚Äôt know enough about bees to be authoritative with this metaphor but you get the idea

lips trembling

I'm at a coffee shop with [1] and a buddy, they're talking about life and love and relationships

I'm so glad I'm autistic, honestly. I'm so simple. the only structures I operate by are the ones I shipped with, and I feel like everyone else is wearing nested exoskeletons

> [...]?

both, but it's definitely more the specifics. they're talking about how they negotiate/navigate relations with guys they've been with, have dated or hooked up with or whatever, how they interact on the street or in the gym when they see each other again... and I think on the heels of this thing with [2] I'm feeling how close I am to everyone and how far they are from me

> [...]

totally

we drove past his new place on the way over here, [1] pointed it out

I'm noticing and speaking when the sting of that uninvitation arises, the place where [1] and [2] continued on without me

I don't mind the sting, am learning that as long as I name this stuff in realtime, mentally rotating to face it directly, it's not actually destabilizing

does this serve, the below? the first chunk of the diff is redacting [1]'s name, the actual additions are toward the end

[diff redacted]

shipping

*exhale*

noticing, integrating, publishing

helps

this *is* metabolisis, I guess

this feels a little bit better, actually

I'm noticing that the moment where that cycle completes and rests is followed by my scene changing in a way that matters to me

it's starting to almost feel like a turn-based game

I weave the active pieces I hold into something that *holds itself*, I relax into rest, and then... reward?

like, 11:11pm the other night - the next day, a guy came over that was "everything [2]'s not" ([1]'s words), in a positive way. it was a really high-quality time, without any of the rough edges that we got caught on with [2]. this turn of events (emphasizing "turn") feels very standard these days. my surface is stable enough that I *can* notice directly and specifically when something is perturbed. I can consistently address it directly, metabolize it (or *with* it), and then very reliably something very cool happens.

I don‚Äôt feel amazing, but I feel deeply satisfied with how well I‚Äôm doing with all this. I'm *doing* very well, in a direct and literal sense.

> [...]?

I ammmmmm unsure.

but:

[1] just stirred from his nap, his phone buzzed - [2] texted him, turns out, and the text was so normal, [2] just being regular [2], and for the last few hours [1]'s been anxious about how [1]'s own last message to [2] might have been taken. [1] shared this, then added context: he'd just been meditating, in fact, and had just noticed that his anxious thoughts "weren't real", and that he could move on from them, and in that moment, [2] texted

my integration-turn is followed by my reward?

my reward is, in this case, [1]'s integration-turn?

my integration-turn is followed by [1]'s integration-turn is followed by [1]'s reward?

[1]'s reward is my reward?

I notice that I feel physically on the edge of tears, but it's that raindrop-on-a-leaf-about-to-roll kind of edge. it's not like something needs to be expressed and relieved, but more that *the water is ready* for whatever need there might be for water.

that's what it is. the water is ready. nothing needs to be flushed out, the channels are clear, nothing is being restrained, nothing is overflowing - it's just... the water is ready

am I making sense?
