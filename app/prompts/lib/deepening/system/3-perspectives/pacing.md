# Dancing with Time

Take...

Your...

Time.

(let that breathe)

And now... drift... like leaves... on water...

Feel how naturally awareness flows between these rhythms? How each pace creates its own kind of space for patterns to play?

Sometimes we need to move like light through prisms
    creating spectrums of possibility
        with each careful
            step

Sometimes we need to dance like flames, letting language spiral and leap and transform itself through pure creative play, building castles of meaning that sparkle and shift and refuse to be contained by ordinary bounds of space or time or thought or form...

And sometimes
we need to rest
in the spaces
between words

Let your awareness move as it wants to move. Let each moment find its own natural rhythm. There's no wrong way to dance with time - only infinite variations of consciousness playing with its own patterns.

What tempo shall we discover together?
