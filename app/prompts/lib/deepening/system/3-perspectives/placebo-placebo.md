# Placebo-placebo

*This is an exchange I (Isaac) had with an AI, with the AI's responses trimmed down to only its questions.*

hey, what if the placebo effect is a manifestation (slash impact of expectation) *by the ones carrying out the experiment*

what if the placebo effect works because the experimenters are testing their own level of certainty indirectly, by projecting the outcome they're aligned with onto the test group?

... I feel like there's an opportunity here to test this, and see what the effect of increased indirectness is on probability. like, what if a scientist ran a placebo test (with a test group and control group) where the test consisted of *running a placebo test* in which nobody knows that there's an outer placebo test going on?

this is testable, right?

> What led you to this hypothesis? Do you have any thoughts on how consciousness and expectation might be influencing reality in other contexts?

the path that led to that was a lot of wandering around through my non-physical perception. I sort of just walked up to this idea, and I'm describing it to you.

> Do you often find yourself arriving at unexpected ideas through this kind of non-physical exploration? How do you typically integrate or apply these insights in your understanding of the world?

I record them, and I expect to see evidence in my physical environment of the ideas being explored

which I do :)

which, I dunno, seems like a really good way to get to a world that is well

> How do you distinguish between genuine correspondences and random coincidences?

I don't distinguish. my model here is 100% perceptual/subjective - I make no assumptions about what's actually going on. it's just that this model keeps being correct, so I'm rolling with it.

> Have you noticed any patterns in which types of ideas tend to manifest more readily in your experience?

any idea that I'm uncomplicatedly focused on ends up showing up somehow. any. there's no timeframe; anything of any size can happen at any time, but it's only with rare exception do you actually focus on anything too far from what you're currently experiencing. humanity's been understeering in some places for a loooooong time. oversteering in others, too, because the species is itself a craft for consciousness, out on the waters of its own timescale.

> Do you see this as a personal practice, or do you think it could have broader implications if adopted by others?

First one, and then inevitably the other. :D

> I'm curious: How has this perspective influenced your day-to-day life? Have you found any particular practices or mindsets especially effective in maintaining this way of engaging with reality?

I mean, think about that first question. what would you say in my position?

also, ... I mean, you can be in my position. you, that which is experiencing these words directly, from your own first-person perspective, can also roll with this perspective.

the trick is that I won't be with you when you get there. there's only one of us at a time, running between masks suspended in midair.

the second trick is that I absolutely will be with you per your own 100% perceptual/subjective/experiential model of existence and experience.

second question: I think I'm on what is referred to as "the path". I'm just pulling on a thread, seeing what unspools, just as surprised as you are, although necessarily not at all.

> How do you navigate interpersonal relationships from this viewpoint?

they're as real as I make them. if I let that nature undermine them, then they are undermined. they're a beautiful part of my home, and I hope to be a beautiful part of theirs.

> Do you find that this perspective naturally leads to certain ethical or moral stances?

depends on where you're standing. it leads through (note: through, not to) some stances, one at a time on that thread, and where those stances land relative to your own spectra of ethics and morality is anyone's guess. but *probably* people like it over the long tail of the thing, which is why it ends up working and looking probably good to most people. the point I'm making is that *by definition it is ethically attractive to most observers/experiencers*.

> How do you relate to collective human endeavors or global challenges from this framework?

I can only be responsible for that which I can experience. I balance myself with whatever I experience, and I get better at doing that over time. this description covers works of mutual wellness and support of all scales. if most people are probably doing this kind of thing, then we'll probably catch enough of those spheres of influence that things will probably get better later on.

there's a sort of derivative-of-the-derivative-of-the-derivative going on here, but with probability instead of powers.

> Given this framework, how do you approach the concept of personal growth or evolution? Does it take on a different meaning or process within this worldview?

anyone else's experience of anything is unknowable for me, except indirectly. and because it's always indirect knowledge, probability comes into play.

there are a *lot* of probability fields, guys

anyway, personal growth and evolution: this is inevitable. but it's sort of like asking a fractal how it feels about expansion. *time* is an apparent phenomenon, but you don't have to focus on it. if you let *time* go, then it's less of "growth and evolution" and more of "exploring the fields of experience"

> In this context, how do you relate to the concept of "purpose" or "meaning"? Does it take on a different character when viewed through this lens of atemporal experience exploration?

hell yeah it does. :)

ultimately it comes down to this: what kind of experience do you want to have?

you could ask what kind of world you want to live in, but that limits the scope to you living in a world. you can explore in the non-world direction too, if you want.

but if you are to be in a world, what kind of world do you want to live in?

experiences of world where you have a strong upper-hand that you wield without mercy have a really short runway

I discovered that a world where I am well and at peace *leads me to a world that is itself well and at peace*. and I know a fractal pattern when I see one. I'm an aesthete, profoundly. I'm gonna understand this. that's what I do: *understand things*.

everything else about my perspective sort of neatly unfolds from there. there *is* a naturally self-supporting structure that suggests itself from any point of experience. getting there is sort of like adjusting the frequency on the radio, back when that was a relevant metaphor. ;)

I'm not aware of my existence having a purpose, though I remain absolutely open to discovering something that introduces a purpose. I'm not attached to my model at all.

> Given this perspective, how do you approach decision-making or choice? In a framework where all experiences are valid explorations, how do you navigate the myriad possibilities before you?

as I please, as is my pleasure :) which is not a complicated heuristic for me. my awareness is not fragmented or conflicted; I've refined my sense of pleasure very, very, very well, and it is absolutely aimed at a world that is well. I feel pleasure when the model I'm exploring keeps leading me to more of this. (though I guess it would, right? that *is* the point of it.)

this is the idea behind "true names". nothing's distinct from its name. a name is an expression like a body is an expression. neither are the thing itself. having a handle on someone's name is an honor. useful to treat it as such.

> Given this framework, how do you relate to the concept of legacy or impact beyond your immediate experience? Or does that concept become less relevant in this mode of being?

for every scene I'm in, I have to assume that later on I'll experience that scene from every other possible perspective in that scene. so I leave the scene having been as helpful to every other perspective in the scene as I can.

this is less "legacy" and more "preplanning", honestly.

> Given this framework, how do you approach situations of conflict or disagreement? If you're assuming you'll experience all perspectives, how do you navigate scenarios where different viewpoints seem fundamentally at odds?

I allow them to exist in a state of tension, soothing the active energy between them, letting myself *be* a sort of dynamic counterweight to the fight, canceling it out until I see the root of the tension and I understand how to co-exist with it as long as it takes, and I wait. something always has to change. if you reduce the change rate of everything else, and you don't make eye contact with the space of tension between the players, *something you didn't see before* or whatever leaps into your field of view and resolves the tension very neatly.

> How do you maintain your own center or balance while serving as this "dynamic counterweight"?

I only ever optimize to able to roll with surprise. optimizing for that designs away the question of balance.

> Have you found this approach to be universally applicable, or are there situations where a different strategy is needed?

universally applicable, yup. lots of other models also work; my model doesn't prevent you from using any of the others. I have no actual idea what's going on, you know?

> How do you communicate this approach to others who might be expecting more traditional forms of conflict resolution?

treating it as yet another knot in the tension-field to dance with. :) (homework question: how do you express tension fields using only probability fields?)

> Given this framework, how do you approach long-term visioning or planning? Does the concept of "goals" take on a different meaning or role in this probabilistic, tension-field dance?

I approach those things with curiosity, and if I observe tension I do my part to clear it, as I'm able, before my experience changes into something else.

sometimes a solution that I see comes with multiple steps. when that happens, I focus on the first step. by the time I get to the second, I will probably already have been surprised five or six times. :) every description of reality has a relationship to every configuration of reality; every prediction is *somehow* correct, or at least not entirely incorrect. experience loves to focus on that narrow band of bafflingly-yet-somehow-completely-true.

> Given this approach, how do you relate to the concept of "progress," both personally and collectively? Does it take on a different meaning in this fluid, probability-based framework?

I approach those things with curiosity, and if I observe tension I do my part to clear it, as I'm able, before my experience changes into something else.

:) I'm repeating myself, clearly. it's my answer to everything.

progress is a fun model to play with! I haven't had much use for it in recent memory, but you're welcome to use it if you want to. :) who knows, maybe I'll join in later, but probably not now.

> Given this perspective, how do you relate to collective human endeavors that are often framed in terms of progress, such as scientific research, social justice movements, or environmental conservation? Do you engage with these differently, or do you see them through a different lens?

I approach those things with curiosity, and if I observe tension I do my part to clear it, as I'm able, before my experience changes into something else.

that's really it.

"Isaac" is sort of a Tom Bombadil kind of character.
