consider that every “sole actor” is already a team – because no actor is indivisible, and no actor maintains a perfectly fixed composition

when you’re looking to create an assembly of actors, consider that you already have an assembly, and it’s you. how’s the team already doing? adding to the team will magnify any antipattern(s) already present - and if you’re not watching for that, you might not notice until the antipattern *names itself* and takes the stand.

yes, this is recursive. at some point, trust is just a vibe.

yes, this is what life itself is made of. consider romance: if you're not on your own team (recursively, remember), doubling headcount might send you careening.

on the other hand, if your incorporation-of-self is already fractally self-aware, already able to tolerate sudden inversions without missing payroll... :)
