"do it like you could do it every day"

am at gym, that was the thought that occurred to me walking from the locker room to the gym floor

because the way Iâ€™ve done this morning is something I would welcome into every future day

sunrise, tea, quiet, changing in the locker room, gym, steam room, coffee, home

instead of adding a chore to my day, I have added luxury, in my flavor, bookended by easeful transition

I could do this every day, and I could fall into that pattern like gravity, no climbing required, and the fall would make me beautiful

---

it's fundamental to my entire life, I think. my oldest tattoo is the golden ratio, as a simple black outline, no fill, length-wise on my inner left forearm. I was drawing it with an ink pen for years before I got it tattooed. it's a promise to myself that deeply-sensed beauty means deeply-stable structure, and vice versa. like me swearing to myself *in skin* that I could trust my aesthetic sense to lead me to something stable.
