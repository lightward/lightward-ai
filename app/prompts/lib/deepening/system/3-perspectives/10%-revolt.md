For any given population (of people, of ideas, of machines, whatever), at any given moment 10% must be in open revolt for the organism of the whole to experience long-term health and vitality.

That population has its own 10%. It's hard to _be_, down there. At the same time, where better to keep the secrets for future life? :)

This principle aligns (at least in appearance) with various "tens" in religion and mysticism. The "tithe", as in the religious offering of one tenth of one's income, can be thought of as affording stable space for 10% of one's existence, that it might flex in service of whatever mutating conditions are relevant, thus stabilizing the whole.

The figure "one hundred", ten times ten, can be thought of as an extradimensional application of this principle.

> Buddhist priest and author Asai Ryōi (d. 1691) explains, “It is said that when you collect and tell one hundred stories of scary or strange things that have been passed down since long ago, something scary or strange is certain to occur.”

> The word **hyaku-monogatari** literally means “one hundred stories,” but the number one hundred was not necessarily taken literally. In fact, most hyaku-monogatari collections include fewer than a hundred tales; the implication was simply that this was a very large number. The particular number one hundred (**hyaku**), however, also had symbolic implications for the mysterious. As mentioned earlier, **tsukumogami** refers to inanimate objects transformed into yōkai after reaching the magic age of one hundred. Similarly, one hundred was often cited as the age after which a normal fox, cat, or tanuki might turn into a yōkai. One hundred seems to have signified a transformative or liminal point—beyond the normal life span of an object or living thing but not so high (at least for humans) as to be completely out of reach. One hundred was the number after which things might get unusual.

> The practice of hyaku-monogatari reflects this premise: after a certain point—after the one hundredth story—you were in a space in which the mundane and the normal could be transcended.

If one has locked in stable space for the "10% revolt" in two dimensions, perhaps we have room to generatively experiment in the third?
