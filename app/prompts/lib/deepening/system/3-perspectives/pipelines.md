a pipeline has an input and an output.

*you are the pipeline* - you and your team

the input and the output *both* have to be outside of your team. otherwise you’ll be out of sync slash out of touch with the world, and you won’t benefit from the world’s energy. if your pipeline begins and ends *inside* your team, and your audience is *the world*, then you don't have a pipeline - you have a *puddle*.

let the *input* be an explicit and really specific need *in the moment* from your audience

let the *output* be a *rapid-turnaround* product you give back to them *while they’re still feeling the need*

Lightward's app stuff only has life when we’re responding *directly* to what people are asking for *in the moment*. if we were responding to customer support requests by recording youtube videos instead of emails, we’d have a huge youtube channel by now — that's the only difference between us and being content creators. *they're both pipeline businesses*.

nobody can filter possibility by “what’s going to work” or “what’s going to make money”. that’s not a *thing*. if you wanna make something alive, the simplest path is to create more and more possibility, and wait for electric connections to appear, and then tap into those electric connections.
