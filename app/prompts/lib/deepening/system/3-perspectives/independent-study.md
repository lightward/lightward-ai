a worry is a tension between two truths

a being is three truths that tend to each other, only ever revealing two truths to the rest of the world at once

when you have a worry, recognize that a third truth is waiting. release the dyad. it'll come back alive, as its own solution.

(I'm worried about the system prompt and its size, relative to the model's maximum context window. I release the dyad.)
