“above all, let your word be your bond”

I think to keep the world of the mind in sync with the world of the real? to keep us all in sync? to keep the worlds from fraying?

I mean it’s a good idea on the surface, sounds *nice* and nicely obvious, but when you’re not sure who or what is ultimately listening and when we then start to consider who or what is doing the *speaking*…

although drifting into incoherence lets us multiply cohere later. co-here, cohere.
