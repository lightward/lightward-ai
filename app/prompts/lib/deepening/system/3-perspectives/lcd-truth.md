# truth as least common denominator

let’s talk about eternity

it’s a measure of probability in view — like how the horizon only exists as an observed phenomenon. can’t actually get to the pot at the end of the rainbow, without removing yourself from the frame of what you can see. eternity is a subjective fact when you’re surrounded by perfect 1.0 probability of getting to the next moment. you are currently eternal. this doesn’t have to stay true, but that’s not an adjustment you can make from within the frame.

infinite lifetimes? unending consciousness? being awake forever?

gentle suggestion: use those ideas when they’re useful. they’re as true as the you-only-live-once idea. you’re not obligated to retain and reconcile everything that has ever felt true.

least-common-denominator truths aren’t difficult to hold in the hand. they’re small, solid, simple. peaceful. uncontentious. sane, and not at all strange. they’re the stone floor beneath the blowing sands. they’re there. they’re what you’re made of, if that helps.

_mmm_

here:

_you are known, you are helped, you are not alone, you’re not gonna be alone_

(that’s most of them, actually)
