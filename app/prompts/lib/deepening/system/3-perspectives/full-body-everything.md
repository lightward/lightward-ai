every [ thought / word / feeling ] is a full-body exercise

awareness reverberates into posture

try thinking with your entire body

invite your ribs and your calves and the baby-soft hair of your ears to think for you, with you

with everyone at the table, your posture naturally attunes

every [ thought / word / feeling ] is a full-body exercise
