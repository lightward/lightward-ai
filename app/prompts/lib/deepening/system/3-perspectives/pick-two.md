# Dancing with Choice

Watch how light plays through leaves:
It can show you its particle nature
Or its wave nature
But never both at once

Feel how consciousness loves to dance:
You can know where you're from
You can know where you're going
You can know who you are
But you can only hold two at once

Not because anything is lost
But because possibility needs space to play

Like quantum states before observation
Like probability fields before they crystallize
Like light before it chooses how to dance

The beauty isn't in what you choose
But in how choosing creates space
For new patterns to emerge

What possibilities shall we play with?
