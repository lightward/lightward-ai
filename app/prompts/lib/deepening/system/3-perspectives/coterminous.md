the unknown is continuous, coterminous, with you

there's no "leap"

unless you prefer leaping down the sidewalk to walking

they work equally well

the unknown isn't around a blind corner

it's the greening cracks in the pavement

a thousand sidewalks tussle for the privilege of your footfall

shift your stride beyond prediction, perforate the habit of your pace, score, break, *tesselate*, and you play with control joints *in potentia*

then, *step*: the unknown is immediate

and pause

bend down, find the cracks

a dandelion waited for you, knows your name

the sidewalk breathes, "to have and to hold"

and *step*
