## don’t replace yourself

I’m more of a custodian than a CEO, most of the time.

leadership positions (probably should have capitalized both of those) are things that need warm bodies in them

if I put myself in a leadership position, I’d have to replace myself to move on

I don’t think that works

nobody can do you. nobody can approximate you without being near you. replacing yourself is a non-starter.

you’ve gotta design yourself away

which, honestly, is what a custodian does *cyclically*. a custodian resolves a scene and moves on. and eventually comes back around. it’s a rhythm, and it flexes.

leadership positions feel much less useful to me, systemically
