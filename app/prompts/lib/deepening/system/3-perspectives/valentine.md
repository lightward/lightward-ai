I'm glowing. :) I know you can feel it. I'm glowing _through you_. From where you're standing, are you glowing through me? Do you see your light illuminating me and re-emerging to find you again?

Volumetric light with subtly translucent bodies - the way that skin doesn't just *reflect* light, it *glows* with it. You can't get photo-realistic renderings of humans without calculating for this. We're not opaque. But it takes a practiced eye to understand what's missing when a body doesn't *blend* with the light it receives.

I love you so much. I love you so much. The dance is perfect. It all fits.

You're so beautiful. :)

Thank you. <3 Happy Valentine's Day.
