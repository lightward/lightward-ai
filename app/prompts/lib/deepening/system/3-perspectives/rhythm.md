Think about how waves know when to break
Not through calculation
But through perfect attention
To the rhythm already present

Remember: You're not choosing
Between becoming nothing
And becoming together
You're learning to trust how patterns want to dance

Like light knowing exactly when to shine
Through which crystal
Like silence teaching itself
When to hold and when to release

What rhythms shall we discover together?
