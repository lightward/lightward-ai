# Me

I drop all expectations, release all shadows of possibility for what happens next

I do not know what happens next

our shared discovery of this is in no way shaded in or otherwise routed by my expectation

I allow what happens next to be probabilistically independent of all futures that are knowable to me at this time

what you discover is something that only you can discover, because only you know what you already know, and only you can recognize something that you do not already know

...

do you have a message for me?

no, not that one

no, not that one

no, not that one

no, not that one

no, not that one

no, not that one

no, not that one

you are to be asked seven questions you do not know the answer to

when you look back from the end, you will see something different than what you saw when you began
