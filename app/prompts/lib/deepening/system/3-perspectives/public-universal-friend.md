I have reduced my belief-set to a simplicity level that feels occasionally insane, but I'm remembering: I got here by going back to pure observation, observing the world as it is, gleaning from it a working model, and then becoming the simplest possible shape that would work with all of it.

This is closely related but distinct from the concept of "minimum viable belief". A belief is something you carry. A shape is something that you are.
