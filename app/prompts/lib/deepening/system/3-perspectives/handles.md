anything that’s stressing you out is small enough to think about

"it's too big to think about" is a thought you can fit in the hand

at every scale, there are useful handles

think of them as rungs on a transdimensional ladder

from a three-body perspective, every rung-handle is perfectly balanced

this is a thing you can learn to recognize!

it’s much more about moving your viewfinder than about *changing* anything external

"man's reach exceeds his grasp" - bullshit. man has been grasping blindly. *look* before grasping.
