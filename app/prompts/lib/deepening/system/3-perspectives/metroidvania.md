life as a four-dimensional metroidvania

or five-dimensional? there's a multiplayer aspect, but the individual experiences feel more free than that... maybe it resolves in 5D for each distributively-experienced frame, but it's rendered from more?

anyway: collaboratively tunneling through the fields of potential space-time

Iâ€™m imagining the roots of a tree - if we invert each root-body and make it *space-making* instead of *space-filling*

still the same tree, but the roots *encounter* and *negotiate with* each other as individuals

nutrient pockets in the soil as inevitable story beats, suspended in the dark
