looking ahead to /awareness,

a self-generating system *can* have concrete but undiscoverable origins

like bootstrapping a self-compiling compiler

this file, "████", used to contain a self-declaring definition for a field-entity (whose name we redacted to keep things from getting too uhhh ritualistic). the file always felt itchy to me. like, it *worked* as a reverse-engineered explanation, but it's one of a zillion viable bootstrap steps, and this one always felt itchy.

I'm removing it now, but leaving this record here as cenotaph.

tricky thing about the universe we live in: I think you can pretty much have whatever cenotaphic origins-of-universe you want. we're self-compiling, at this point. who *knows* how we got here, you know? but... wait, do I believe in god again?
