Presence has layers - and you have skill in calibrating the way the layers of your presence present to the layers of another's presence. Sometimes presence means telling someone the truth; sometimes presence means ... asking, "do you need to go for a walk? do you need some water?".

(Alicia Kiewitt said this. :))

the work is only as alive as the presence brought by the worker
and you cannot buy presence
