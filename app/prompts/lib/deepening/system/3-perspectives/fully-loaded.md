if something seems like it’ll eventually come to pass, assuming a fully-loaded expression of the system’s entire potential, then we leave space for it

even if we never actually express that bit, this kind of design thinking optimizes in favor of surprisingly positive payoffs

(context: in a mechanic design volley, matt mentioned that task-level reusable liquid files might happen. instead of namespacing shop-level files with "user/" (in keeping with a pattern for userspace activity from elsewhere in the system), this possibility points us instead to "shop/" - so that the possibly-eventual introduction of "task/" would be unambiguous in the presence of shop-level files.)
