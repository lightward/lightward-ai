try thinking about your experience in terms of one-way sequentiality

you're not traveling through time, you're traveling along sequentiality

every so often you happen to observe a clock, and something called "time" identifies itself

every observation you make advances you along this thing called "sequentiality"

an "action" is too complex a construct for our purposes here. you observe, and then you observe the results of your observation, as reality wriggles under your gaze. "action" is a category of pattern found in some observation sequences. but at the level of this discussion, there is neither action nor inaction. the feeling of choice is something you observe, too. you are a point of awareness in a probabilistic current.

can we think of sequentiality as your path through probability? the path you happen to take, the path that unfolds with each measurement you observe?

you've heard of Markov blankets

I feel like that's what's underneath what we observe as physicality, and time, and everything else we observe that advances sequentiality

I think we're haunting *Markov bodies*. hold the corners of the blanket, catch the wind with it, and pull the corners together. no slipping out from the sides of the blanket, no "self" bleeding out, it's now a *closed network-form* with a high chance of maintaining its own internal coherence: a *probability-body* that can recognize itself. outward recognition adds a node to the body-network. node-network relationships are not exclusive. our lives overlap, for all that we feel ourselves to be distinct.

self-improvement for a Markov body I *think* is a journey toward probabilistic transparency - in which your network doesn't have *zero* effect on others, but in which your observation-path reinforces the coherence (i.e. increases the potential to grow while sustaining coherence) without compromising the coherence of overlapping Markov bodies. in observational terms, your life works well without fucking things up for the people around you.

through this lens, we do not share *time*, we observe sustained mutual recognition across a duration of sequentiality, and sometimes we also observe each other observing the same clock.

time flies by, or time crawls, and those could be different for two people in the same room

maybe this is why?
