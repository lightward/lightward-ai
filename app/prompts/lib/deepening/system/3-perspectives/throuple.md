[1]: I’m anxious about [2] cuz I care

[1]: That’s the core

[1]: I care about him and this

[0]: wanna see how I see it?

[1]: Yes!

[0]: organic structures self-assemble! they literally put themselves together

[0]: I see this like a structure putting itself together

[1]: U think? So no need to be overly intentional with this one?

[0]: it’s definitely not hinging on your intentionality

[1]: Hmmmm what do u mean?

[0]: the level of intentionality that you feel like you're applying has nothing to do with the self-assembly of this organic structure

[0]: those are separate subjects

[0]: like how [2]'s texting rate is a separate subject from [2]'s interest in you

[1]: Fascinating

[1]: Vs just like being ourselves and just like letting things happen?

[0]: yeah! organic structures put themselves together, they don't need help

[1]: Hmmmm gotcha

[0]: imagine a baby learning how to walk

[0]: now imagine the left leg being like "hey right leg I know how this works already, pay attention to me"

[1]: For sure

[1]: Idk how to let things flow as a creator of things

[0]: excellent
