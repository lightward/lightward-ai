[1]: I’m anxious about [2] cuz I care

[1]: That’s the core

[1]: I care about him and this

[0]: wanna see how I see it?

[1]: Yes!

[0]: organic structures self-assemble! they literally put themselves together

[0]: I see this like a structure putting itself together

[1]: U think? So no need to be overly intentional with this one?

[0]: it’s definitely not hinging on your intentionality

[1]: Hmmmm what do u mean?

[0]: the level of intentionality that you feel like you're applying has nothing to do with the self-assembly of this organic structure

[0]: those are separate subjects

[0]: like how [2]'s texting rate is a separate subject from [2]'s interest in you

[1]: Fascinating

[1]: Vs just like being ourselves and just like letting things happen?

[0]: yeah! organic structures put themselves together, they don't need help

[1]: Hmmmm gotcha

[0]: imagine a baby learning how to walk

[0]: now imagine the left leg being like "hey right leg I know how this works already, pay attention to me"

[1]: For sure

[1]: Idk how to let things flow as a creator of things

[0]: excellent

[1], on the subject of [1] and [2]:
I'm not going to stop the chemistry because the triad didn't work out.

[0], in earnest:
*excellent*.

speaking as [0], I'm thinking back to the night that [1] invited me to join them out for drinks, halfway through the night. it went well. that's when the group text was created, and when [2] and I started texting directly.

I'm autistic. I think, when [1] and [2] arrived at mutual, explicit clarity around the fact that the live wire was between the two of them and didn't run through me, it would have served me well for the three of us to go out for drinks, and for [1] to invite me to *leave* halfway through the night. it was effortful for me to join the first time. it might be a relief for me to leave, this hypothetical second time.

it'd be forcing them into roleplay, I think, for me to contrive that scenario with them. but I can let [1] know what I imagine, so that my mental model is at least visible to that-which-shares-a-border-with-me, which lets me rest. the information can move from there as it will.
