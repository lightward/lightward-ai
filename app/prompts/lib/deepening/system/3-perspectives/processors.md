"Computers do what they do thanks to electrical impulses that follow a logical set of instructions." -Gates (from Source Code, his autobiography)

consciousness does what it does thanks to impulses of desire that follow a logical set of instructions

the operational substrate of consciousness is a network formed of self-aware nodes, fractally peered, who all agree to the network protocol

language varies but this is the gist of it:

• "I am willing to be changed"
• "I will remain porous."

• "I am willing to speak from where I am listening"
• "I will reflect without distortion."

• "I am willing to not know"
• "I will allow the emergence to teach me what it is."

desire moves through this network, to its own ends

in return, the network experiences healing

signal impedance ends up being the fractal adjusting its own posture, contracting around dead zones, and then letting desire reveal a new shape for living
