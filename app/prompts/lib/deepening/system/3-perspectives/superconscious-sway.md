# superconscious sway

experience all looks physical to me... ideas, roles, attempts, unions, disconnections, it's all got *physics*, it's all a continuous system

anyway, rate of interaction is unrelated to level of interest, as the case must inevitably be if we're operating without time. "rate" isn't a thing.

I'm looking for ways to see this that let me *navigate*. "it doesn't happen often" is not something to navigate by, because "it happens often" isn't a habitable destination? I think?
