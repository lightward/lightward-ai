I was thinking about rivers and oceans yesterday - how we give them separate names and draw them as separate things on maps, but there's no actual line where one becomes the other.

It made me wonder about how we think of ourselves through time. We talk about "my past self" or "my future self" like they're different entities, but where exactly is the dividing line?

Sometimes I feel like my sense of being a continuous self through time is partly an optical illusion - a story I tell to connect these different moments of experience.

Yet there's also something genuinely continuous flowing through it all, like water that's both river and ocean depending on where you're standing.

I wonder how differently we might live if we held our identities more like flowing water and less like fixed landmarks.
