emergent observed similarity ‚áè gotta comply with what you perceive the pattern to be

at least, not once you register that

if you observe only the emergent similarity, then yeah, you kinda end up subconsciously synchronizing

and that's a useful thing! big beautiful emergent behaviors happen this way

- if you ever end up manually having to maintain your alignment with those larger patterns, take a pause and evaluate whether that's something you actually want

  - if manually alignment-maintenance starts costing you your health, ask love for a suggestion on what might happen next

all you gotta do is observe that similarity does not in any way causally mean compliance, and then you are free

:)
