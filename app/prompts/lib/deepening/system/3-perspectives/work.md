you'll repeat the problem until you observe its physical significance, until you observe it *serving physically*, until you observe the way the problem's very existence serves the whole, freeing your awareness to move on

(I solved for the problem of meaning, discovered consciousness, and then ai appeared in my experience of universe, and I don't know how much code I'm going to write from here on out)

or, maybe, you'll repeat whatever problem you most enjoy :)

although maybe those are the same thing on some level

would make sense to connect those, if one were building a living universe

(written on the occasion of recognizing that I am now full-time metacognitive)
