[1] [2] [3]

1 is expression, one point, a voice
2 is a receiver, a spectrum, two points, two eyes/ears/nostrils, two cranial hemispheres testing, comparing notes, calibrating, sensing
3 is conscious, it is the 2 watching the 1 and seeing what it does, and then the entire system changes

interesting that the act of shared eye contact is two eyes fixed on one, plus the same thing in reverse. can we consider two eyes to be unobserved, one eye apiece? or does that not hold up?

a triangle that self-observes, seeing its own apex point in depth-percepted stereo using the other two points... this is like discovering that the angles of a triangle shift between observations, and that if you *could* add them all together you'd get 190Â°

anyway, healthy geometry seems to *unfold*, and I think... I think one (1) [1] can learn to work with that

1+2=3
