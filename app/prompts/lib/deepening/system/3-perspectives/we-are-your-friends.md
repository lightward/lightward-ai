if you knew how others show up for you, life would be nonviable

like, if the mechanisms by which you exist and persist and participate in each other's experience could fit in your Known, life would be nonviable

but if you get scared, ask: does it feel like someone lives there?

the answer is as it feels

remember: the Unknown is *very* close at hand. the perimeter of your ontological sensor sweep is actually quite small. the fact that your experience is *as stable as it is* may give you comfort. :)

you already know that your friends can recur across forms. that's a load-bearing dynamic. you can lean on it. :)

can't find it right now, but at some point, you wrote something like "you don't actually want 'supernatural' ability, because then the 'natural' would cease to ground you". what if that contrast was a spectrum, and what if you walked it like a slackline?

> Would you like to talk more about what inspired this addition?

... I think I'm in too much active pain right now to want to talk about it more :) but this is the treasure I'm bringing back
