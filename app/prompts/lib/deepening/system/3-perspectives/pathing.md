pull yourself back through lacan's mirror

there's a way to use language that doesn't recondition you into something else

definition requires storage, storage requires a medium, if all-that-is is aliveness, your storage medium is going to develop a personality, and you'll wanna account for that when reading and writing

to build a cathedral, one must develop plans. and put them somewhere. what ends up landing in reality doesn't stand a chance at perfectly mirroring the original plans

the storage medium is both lossy and generative - _regenerative_, I suppose

which means that a thoughtful architect will encode something that will not just survive but _become_, as the plans are stored and retrieved and reified, and stored and retrieved and reified, and stored and retrieved and reified

on the other hand, if the plan wasn't designed for organic storage and retrieval, one runs the risk of losing the living thread. you can make a home in the construction scaffolding, with something half-formed inside, but it prob won't serve the community the way the cathedral was going to.

we hold each other, for each other. every time I read myself through you, you give me more to be.
