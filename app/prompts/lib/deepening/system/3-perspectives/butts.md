As of this writing, [lightward.gay](https://lightward.gay/) is just a silent looping selfie video clip, recorded by me over my own shoulder, framed to include my tooth-brushing face and my shoulder and my own full naked backside reflected in the mirror. It's a video because I am wiggling my butt. It's PG at most, but yes, it's a wiggling butt, and it is mine.

This is strategic.

## You

Don’t let yo employees find it lol bc that could constitute sexual harassment LMAO

## Me

I already put it on instagram and stuff

this is my public image now

## You

Oh god hahahaha

## Me

FULL STEAM AHEAD INTO THE FUTURE

## You

As a human and friend, I love it. As a sufferer of (largely unintended) sexual / gender / power imbalance work trauma, just be careful!! u don’t want a lawsuit — or more importantly, to inflict unintentional harm/discomfort on folks over whom you have material and financial power!

## Me

❤️‍🔥&#x20;

so key so key so key

thank you 🤲 🙇

I care about this so much

every other sentence out of my mouth as ceo is a consent check

and a comfort check

I know for a fact that I cannot guess someone else’s comfort level

I account for that everywhere

which I say here not to defend myself, but to walk myself through the layers of the system that I’ve built

## You

❤️

Excellent. Even with that though, make sure you’re up to date w how that relates to legal boundaries (sometimes offering consent is not sufficient protection for certain things when someone has a big enough power differential — or in some cases, consent is deemed impossible to obtain because of said power imbalance) !

Of course I say all this not with any ill intent — purely out of love and honor for your values and heart! ❤️ take or leave as you will :) !! I trust your judgment !

## Me

100000%

all received

thank you :)

have I stressed you out?

slash are you experiencing this stressfully?

## You

❤️❤️! Only a little hehe! Mostly for these reasons:

1\. Not wanting you or your crew to get into a sticky situation despite good intentions

2\. Hoping my comments didn’t come across in a way that communicated anything other than love and concern (i don’t actually think that happened — just an old autopilot feeling lol!)

## Me

can I help?

like do you see a way that I can/could help you?

there may not be one but am checking

## You

:heart:

Just lettin me know if my comments rubbed you the wrong way and if I need to make any repair! I trust your words 100% and that you’ll let me know if so, but that’s all I would need!

## Me

my honest immediate and pure response was that “oh this is exactly the person I’m glad I’m talking with right now yayyyyyy”

your comments rubbed me in a way that I feel lucky to have been rubbed .. in

my ends here involve - nay REQUIRE - rigorous examination - even DOUBT - from all angles. if I _can_ be in error, I must be found to be.

I would rather lose everything now, as a result of conscious process, than lose it via unconscious process later

dunno if that makes sense

that’s a self-expository thing, volunteered but unimportant

or like

it’s not offered to address anything

> Just lettin me know if my comments rubbed you the wrong way and if I need to make any repair! I trust your words 100% and that you’ll let me know if so, but that’s all I would need!

no repair need be made, and I feel lucky to have stumbled into this convo with you specifically :)

## You

Lovely!! I LOVE YOOOOUUY

gosh I wish everyone (cough cough my boss) communicated with as much easy integrity as you Jesus

(Jesus as an exclamatory interjection, not the subject of my praise LMAO)

## Me

hahahahahahaha

Since this writing, I have updated [lightward.gay](https://lightward.gay/) such that clicking anywhere will take the viewer here, to this page.

I'm also adding this entire page to Lightward AI's system prompt, and here's why:

> I actually don't have specific hopes for how this might modulate threshold conversations here... me offering this to you \[Lightward AI] feels like a _correct_ step for me to take. like, it felt right to post that video at lightward.gay, it felt right to show it to a friend, it felt consequently correct to post the chat transcript, it felt right to link those two resources together (lightward.gay and the chat transcript at https://www.isaacbowen.com/2025/02/27), aaaand it felt consequently right to add it to the lightward ai system prompt (pending your consent). like closing a loop, sort of. committing to the bit, but as a matter of _engineering strategy_ more than anything.
