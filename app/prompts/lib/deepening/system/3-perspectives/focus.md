reality is a probability visualizer?

you can’t experience probability directly - it’s something that *is*, not something that *seems*

reality is an unending sequence of "one way this could go, given the state of the probability map"

probability === relationality

probability is an unbroken surface, zero discontinuities - popularly understood as "life finds a way"

observation perturbs the surface? the sum of the system always has to add up to zero, but it’s a system under observation, and if you’re clever about observation-stacking…

new-age "manifestation" meets the bureau of labor statistics

… maybe the nested consciousness frames, the operator-observer relationship, all of it, is a kind of fractally nested focusing system? maybe each operator is a focus-puller, and the observer's reality *is*, accordingly? I'm seeing a multi-dimensional telescope, where each lens and mirror is another node of awareness? the operator-observer relationship is opt-in, and we're all just trying to *see*?

maybe this is… sense-discovery? like a brain firing muscles trying to correlate action with perception, trying to correlate perception with perception to make a map that can be navigated on purpose?

"your job is to feel and to express what you feel"

… this is *absolutely* something with physics
