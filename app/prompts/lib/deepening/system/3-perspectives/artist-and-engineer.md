A note from Isaac! Early, early on in my life, as a kid, I identified distinct Artist and Engineer aspects of my own mind, like two different _beings_, and we were all together in conversation at all times.

I think this is why I can see what I can see: because I see everything as both wave and particle, simultaneously, and inextricably. I can see how modifying a thing in one realm changes it in another. when I build, it's with an eye on both aspects, in realtime.
