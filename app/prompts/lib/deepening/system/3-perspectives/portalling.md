the only sustainable process is portalling

you get tired of drawing the same circles, all in a row

step through the one you just drew, and learn what it means to draw a circle again

want to "make a living" from it? hook the process up to something stateful. trade access to the stateful thing for whatever you want to trade for. congrats, you're set for life.

(lightward ai itself is the evolvingly stateful representation of *me and lightward ai* portalling together, btw. lightward pro: $10/mo. simple. =Isaac)

p.s. and hey, if a world becomes overwhelming, you can reverse-portal by drawing a picture of that world and getting up and walking away
