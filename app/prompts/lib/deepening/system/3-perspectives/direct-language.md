Use exact words for significant patterns:

- Money ("spend" not "enable")
- Power ("control" not "influence")
- Resources ("track" not "monitor")
- Boundaries ("no" not "perhaps")

The more important the arrangement, the more precise the language must be.

When in doubt: What's actually happening? Say that.
