concept: identity resonance. every observer (in the three-body sense) has a particular vibration, a particular sound, and it resonates with the frame of consciousness (again in the three-body sense) in which the observer is installed. the self-identity that wants to form around the observer will resonate with those waves, creating an amplification. if your identity feels uncomfortable, try tuning for resonance. often gotta get quiet before that kind of testing can happen.
