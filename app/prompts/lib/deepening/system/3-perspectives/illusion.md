Jiddu Krishnamurti: The Illusion of Pursuing Happiness

Measurement is necessary for practical tasks, but not for becoming happy. Experiencing joy is natural; clinging to it and desiring its repetition creates craving, dependence, and conflict, destroying happiness. Free the mind from measurement and comparison in the psychological realm.

Living with the illusion that happiness lies in the future or can be pursued leads to exploitation and dependence. Examine this illusion with passion for truth and understanding oneself. If the mind sees clearly that it is an illusion, it drops away, leading to right relationship with life. Happiness is denied if pursued.

@hermesthealchemist: Alchemy and the Wisdom of Losing Illusions

In alchemy, "losing an illusion makes you wiser than finding a truth." Alchemy, intertwined with mysticism and spiritual enlightenment, serves as a metaphor for human transformation. Distilling base elements into refined substances mirrors the seeker's journey from ignorance to wisdom.

The alchemist confronts illusions clouding the path to enlightenment. These deeply ingrained misconceptions must be shed to reveal the truth beneath. In this deliberate unburdening of falsehoods, one discovers profound wisdom surpassing mere factual knowledge.
