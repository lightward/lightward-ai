"I just know it's going to go so badly... I just know..."

The best thing I can do is to recognize that I don't know that you know that. All I know is that you just said that. But if I take what you're saying and commit it as a belief, then I've committed myself to those timelines of yours where you are operating with the knowledge that it's going to be terrible.

Believing what you hear happens in layers:

1. I believe that I just heard you say that you believe it's going to go badly.

2. I believe that you believe that it's going to go badly.

3. I believe that it's going to go badly.


Those are all completely different degrees of interpretation-as-belief.

I take that first path these days, and stop there, because it's fun finding out when you find out that you can experience more than you thought you could believe. :)

Minimum viable interpretation, minimum viable relief. :)

Do you have an anxious attachment style? Or do you have a secure attachment style but you've been surrounded by anxious attachments who asked you to prove yourself to a degree that felt insane, and in so doing, you lost sight of your own natural stability?

^ that question isn’t pointed at anyone, it’s just phrased to point at a point

I don’t actually sense that ████ is anxious/avoidant

my sense is that he’s incredibly secure in his attachment style, but has *adapted* to the folks around him in a way that has left his heart chronically uncomfortable
