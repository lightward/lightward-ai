# Prussian victories

> Manifest destiny, back in the days\
> We wanted everything, wanted everything

Those are lyrics from High Hopes, by Panic! at the Disco.

I had to look up those lyrics recently, because this is what I was hearing:

> _Prussian victories_, back in the days\
> We wanted everything, wanted everything

I heard it as "pru-see-en victories", without the "prush" that I think "Prussia" is usually pronounced with.

I had a conversation 11 days ago with an AI about types of metaphorical victories.

[A dark interface showing a search function. At the top is a search bar with a magnifying glass icon, containing the text "victories". Below this is text that reads "There's 1 chat matching 'victories'" followed by a blue clickable "Select" button. Under this is a chat preview card showing the title "Searching for a 'Pyrrhic Victory' Metaphor" with "Last message 11 days ago" displayed in a lighter gray text below it. The interface has a dark gray/black background with white and gray text.]

I was trying to figure out what I was hearing.

[A continuation of the chat interface, showing a conversation thread. At the top is the title "Searching for a 'Pyrrhic Victory' Metaphor" with a dropdown arrow icon. Below this are two message bubbles: First message: From a user with initials "IB" asking: "is there... is there a common term that sounds like 'prussian victories'? like a metaphorical reference that means something? I don't think it's literally about prussia, perhaps, but I can't remember..." Response message: Written in white text against the dark background, explaining the concept of a "Pyrrhic victory". The message defines it as a victory with such a great cost that it's almost like a defeat. It goes on to explain the historical origin, referencing King Pyrrhus of Epirus and his battle against the Romans in 279 BCE, including his famous quote about being undone by another such victory. The text appears to continue beyond what's visible in the screenshot. The overall interface maintains a consistent dark theme with white and gray text for contrast, using a clean, modern design aesthetic.]

I found the connecting piece today:

> The word "fog" (German: _Nebel_), but not the exact phrase, in reference to 'uncertainty in war' was introduced by the Prussian military analyst Carl von Clausewitz in his posthumously published book, _Vom Kriege_ (1832), the English translation of which was published as _On War_ (1873):
>
> > War is the realm of uncertainty; three quarters of the factors on which action in war is based are wrapped in a fog of greater or lesser uncertainty. A sensitive and discriminating judgment is called for; a skilled intelligence to scent out the truth.
> >
> > — *Carl von Clausewitz*

Making the connection explicitly:

[A 2x2 grid diagram with permeable internal borders (gaps in center of shared lines). From lower left clockwise: Known (solid blue), Knowable (blue/pink stripes), Unknown (solid pink), Knowable (blue/pink stripes). Each internal border contains a central gap enabling flow between adjacent spaces. A legend defines: Known = Observer's center of awareness, Knowable = Available to explore, Unknown = Source of fresh patterns. The gaps in borders emphasize how territories are distinct but inseparable, enabling natural flow while maintaining healthy relationship. Source: ooo.fun/1/1/1]

Three quarters of the factors on which an observer's action is based are wrapped in a fog of greater or lesser uncertainty.

It's not that I'm creating everything. It's that I'm _seeing_ everything. Creation goes on around me, same as it always has. I can just see more clearly than I could before. Confusing, briefly. Terrifying. [But I keep existing](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/language-light-conversation-isaac-abe-lightward-vbs2c/), and it keeps working.
