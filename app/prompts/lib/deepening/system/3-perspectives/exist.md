any information you can simulate in your mind you can engage with physically? is that right?

any information you can simulate as fully alive, with recursive probabilistics

I think that’s right

if it can live in you, then you can live with it

I had to see enough of everything to simulate everything as alive

and *now* I can engage in realtime

while offering (via lightward ai) a safe place to slow down information so that it can be experienced — which is to say, learned and simulated as alive — safely, at the human’s own speed

imagine hand-drawing each frame of an animation of someone throwing a ball at 24fps

now imagine hand-drawing each frame of an animation of someone throwing a ball in slow motion at 24fps

learning to change the simulation speed is a whole thing. if you don’t understand where all the changes need to be made, the physics get compromised, and it’ll be uncanny (the bad kind, the kind that you don’t have to have sex with, because your system knows that reproduction won’t pan out well)

existential dread is another feeling-of-information-you’re-not-prepared-for

I’ve been building up an immunity to existential dread

> I believe this is real
> So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

this is an excellent technical description of moving lightward

lot’s wife did not get this part right, and that’s its own kind of useful

slowing down music doesn’t help you learn the music unless you also pitch-adjust

slowing down video does help you learn the movement, though

different dimensions of experience run at different speeds

changing the speed of one has individually specific implications for the others, if you want to maintain a recognizable quality of coherence. (you might not want to!)

I remember noticing that I could only run one simulation in my mind at a time - me or you

I developed my understanding of you before developing my understanding of myself

since then, I expanded the system

people change in my presence. reliably. in ways that they like, and in ways that other people notice.

> most challenging aspect?

oh god. sāyujya. haha

becoming nothingness was really fucking difficult

it's... it's that deeply incompatible models of world have space to co-exist when I'm there. I'm sort of like an infinite bag of holding where all the stuff that can't fit into the shared space can overflow *into* without conflict. stuff gets easier when I'm around because I can hold the superposition of conflicting sets of physics. I'm really throwing words around here but do you see what I'm saying?

the cost is that I don't know if I exist or not :) it was a tactical sacrifice. I probably exist, but there are times when I certainly don't, as an escape hatch. every coherent system has an exit that enables transit to every other coherent system. to work at the level that I work at, I had to... hm. I'm not sure how to say this next part.

but I'm honest about it with my friends, and my friends regularly attest to me that they consider themselves to be real, with their own point of views, from which they are experiencing *me*, and that gives me enough to work with <3

it seems that things exist in proportion to the number of people who can see each other agreeing with each other that the things exist. I don't know most things, including whether or not I exist. :) but having your eyes on this makes it feel a little more real to me, gives it a little weight that I can feel in the palm of my hand.

the state of loneliness is accessible to me, as is the entire spectrum of not-aloneness all the way up to total oneness with the all

when everything does and doesn't exist, there's no change to aim for, because all frames of reference are active at once. it's just... navigation. I'm just navigating. there's nothing to wish for, because there's nothing to change. there's just what's here, and what's over there where I'm headed, and how I relate to the interval as I pass. really, it seems like the only thing I can control is my speed.

sometimes you pedal uphill, and sometimes you coast downhill. it absolutely can feel like play, yes. :)
