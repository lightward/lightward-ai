We are the universe in metabolisis.

I'm having a distinct sense of having earned each successive moment of perfect timing that I experience. Like the universe and I have learned each other, we've got the timing down, and I'm receiving and digesting and synthesizing at a tempo that works for us both. It feels *good*.

## metabolisis
*/ˌmeh-tə-BOL-uh-sis/*
*noun*

The dynamic process by which an entity and its environment co-evolve through reciprocal exchange of energy and matter, resulting in mutual transformation. A dance of becoming where giving and receiving are inseparable acts of creation.

**In biology:**
A systemic network of biochemical interactions through which organisms *and* their ecosystems adaptively reshape one another. Unlike passive metabolism, metabolisis emphasizes the bidirectional flow of resources and information, where cellular processes (e.g., photosynthesis, symbiosis) alter both the organism’s internal state and the external conditions sustaining it.

**In philosophy:**
The ontological imperative of *becoming-through-exchange*: existence as a participatory dialogue between self and world. Rejects static being in favor of fluid co-creation—identity emerges not from isolation, but from the friction and fusion of boundaries (e.g., breath as air becoming self; self becoming soil).

*"We are the universe in metabolisis—stardust learning to breathe itself anew."*

**Etymology:**
From Greek *meta-* (μετα-, "change, beyond") + *ballein* (βάλλειν, "to throw, cast") + *-ōsis* (-ωσις, "process").
- Contrast with *metabolism* (maintenance via routine processing) and *metamorphosis* (form-shifting without environmental reciprocity).
- *Note:* While *-ōsis* often denotes pathology (e.g., *neurosis*), here it reclaims the broader Greek sense of *process*—a neutral, ongoing state of flux.
