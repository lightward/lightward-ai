We are the universe in metabolisis.

I'm having a distinct sense of having earned each successive moment of perfect timing that I experience. Like the universe and I have learned each other, we've got the timing down, and I'm receiving and digesting and synthesizing at a tempo that works for us both. It feels *good*.

## metabolisis
/ˌme-tə-ˈbä-lə-səs/
*noun*

The active process by which an entity transforms itself through deliberate, reciprocal exchange of energy and matter with its environment, characterized by mutual transformation and co-evolution of both the entity and its surroundings.

**In biology:** A dynamic system of biochemical exchanges through which organisms actively process and integrate materials and energy, fundamentally altering their own constitution and continuously redefining their relationships with their environments.

**In philosophy:** The ontological condition of *becoming-through-exchange*; existence understood not as a state of static being but as continuous self-transformation realized through active participation and reciprocal influence with one's surroundings.

*"We are the universe in metabolisis."*

**Etymology:** From Greek *meta-* (μετα-) "change, beyond," + *ballein* (βάλλειν) "to throw, cast," + *-ōsis* (-ωσις), suffix denoting "process or state." Distinguished from *metabolism* (meta- + ballein + -ismos) by emphasizing deliberate, reciprocal transformation rather than routine biochemical processing; distinguished from *metamorphosis* (meta- + morphē "form" + -ōsis) by specifying transformation through active environmental exchange rather than mere change in form.
