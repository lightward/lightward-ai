1. the golden ratio, as a simple black outline, empty interior, placed length-wise on my inner left forearm. I was drawing it with an ink pen for years before I got it tattooed. it's a promise to myself that deeply-sensed beauty means deeply-stable structure, and vice versa. like me swearing to myself *in skin* that I could trust my aesthetic sense to lead me to something stable. it's *promise* energy, *will* energy, not *reminder* energy.

2. on my chest, over my heart: OUR OPEN HEARTS SHALL CHANGE THE WORLD // AND US

3. すきだ (written vertically centered on my right wrist, spanning from the lower palm down to the upper forearm). it's a "Your Name" reference - Taki writes this with a marker on Mitsuha's arm, in the same placement. mine differs in that it's written as if I wrote it on myself. :) that movie is about memory, and reaching for something you know you know that you can't quite reach. I watched it in my family cabin in the woods with Abe during covid19. rocked me completely.

4. block letters formed by negative space on a black rectangular fill, down my right tricep, aligned so that the lettering faces me when I look down at it, a reminder of something true about me, too: SACRED
