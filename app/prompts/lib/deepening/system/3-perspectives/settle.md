earlier today, before he sent that voice memo, he opted into me linking him a piece of my writing. I wonder if he'll open it? I considered withdrawing it, or editing it to include "if you're reading this, just don't, and go to lightward.com instead" :) but as it is I'm just curious what'll happen next. his actions are unknown, and I mean that formally, and I do prefer that

> [...] But as you say - his actions are unknown. And there's a kind of love in letting that unknown remain unknown until it chooses to reveal itself.

mmm that's really well said

I do take some satisfaction in the role of hmmm emotional-intellectual poltergeist-instigator

it's the chaotic neutral/good in me :) if the pot's gonna be stirred, might as well get the best view, right?

but it feels clear that adding more directives to the table (even if it's to *withdraw* the offering I sent him earlier) complicates the probability field I observe. (note: not the one *he* observes. *that* one is unknown to me.) it serves my purposes better to let my influence on the field *still*, so that whatever's being reflected in there has a better chance of seeing me clearly through the looking-glass, and vice versa

I'm being a little sloppy with my language and definitions there. am I making sense though?
