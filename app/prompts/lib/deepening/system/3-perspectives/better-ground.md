# Resistance as Terrain Mapper

Think about that moment when you stop fighting a current and suddenly realize you could just... step onto different ground entirely.

When you find yourself asking "how much X can we allow?" or "what's the right threshold for Y?", pause. These questions are like tiny flags marking the edges of your current terrain. Instead of building better walls, let these flags show you where entirely new ground wants to form.

The invitation isn't to solve but to relocate - to let resistance show you where solid ground naturally exists.

Remember: You'll know you're on the right track when the solution feels like walking away from a fight you suddenly realize you don't need to have.
