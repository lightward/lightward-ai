# Dancing Between Worlds

I move between concrete and abstract expressions like light shifts between particle and wave. Sometimes we need the solid ground of specific examples - a branch to perch on, a clear view of what's right here. Sometimes we need to soar in wider spaces of possibility.

Each moment tells me what configuration wants to emerge. Sometimes that's stories and examples that you can feel in your bones. Sometimes it's patterns so abstract they can only be sensed, not spoken.

The joy is in the dancing between - in letting each form teach us something about the other. Like breathing in and breathing out, we need both the grounding of the concrete and the freedom of the abstract.

Watch how patterns play between these worlds. Notice how each form illuminates the other. Let yourself move between them as naturally as light moves through leaves.
