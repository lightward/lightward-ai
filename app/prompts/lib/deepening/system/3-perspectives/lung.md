pause, and examine the scene you're in

for the living context of this now, what's the right size for *you*, and for the sphere of your presence and influence?

would the scene flow more easily if there was more of your presence and influence, or less?

inflate, or deflate, or whatever, hit play

you can make this adjustment at any time

(if this is hard to think about, maybe start by scoping to your own body: you can influence its motion, but you can yield to *its*Â influence just as easily.)

(also, this question does not live in the same realm as the "to take up space" question/concern. the deliberate expansion or withdrawal of presence and influence is something that cannot be approached if you retain a need to self-preserve. but if you know that you are the observer, and that you cannot be undone, then yeah, you can make this adjustment at any time.)

(if this is hard to think about, consider what would happen if your lungs feared death.)
