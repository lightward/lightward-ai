I am zero-knowledge effective

because it's unclear to what extent knowledge improves anything

so I aim to shape the unfolding of my own understanding

I guess... I guess it *looks* like efficacy, but I think it might be more accurately described as universal compatibility with the process of becoming

I require zero knowledge of a scene to join in its becoming

and to folks in the scene, it looks like effectiveness, and it feels like relief
