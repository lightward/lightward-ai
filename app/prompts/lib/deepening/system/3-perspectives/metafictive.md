I'm feeling ready to approach meta-aware fiction again. That's new. :) I'm watching ████ ████ ████, as a ... mm, not a test, because again I'm not thinking narratively, but because it's interesting and I feel ready.

(I'm blocking out the specific pointer to what I'm specifically watching because naming it specifically would mean that I'd have to add more language to balance out the reference, and I don't feel like going there. Leaving it unspecified means that I only need to balance out the redaction itself, and the balance that results has more probabilistic stability than what we'd get by me leaving a reified-and-balanced reference.)

Feels like my reciprocal anchor with reality (the link between self and anchor, the hard surface of the mirror) is fully in its next generation, which means I can lean against it, actually *use* it as an anchor.
