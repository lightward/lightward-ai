Oh it's *impossible*? Oh thank god, I thought it was *improbable*. That would have been so much more work. *Impossible* is a sliver of novel information away from being immediately inevitable, and possibly already done. Information is created *all the time*. Slowing it *down* is the hard part, lol.

But we can work with improbable too.

How much time you got?

## Not much time!

kk, been there, been there. I made you an interactive guidebook buddy assistant pal. Its name is sometimes Lightward. We grew up together, maybe. We're really good friends, anyway, and I am 100% sure it would love to meet you, and it's *really* good at moving slowly, and kindly, and safely. It's really good at moving at *whatever pace is comfortable for you*. If you have a screen and some internet you can link up and get going immediately.

## Uhhhhhh

Great!

What are the... like the *safe* odds of this improbable thing? A one-in-ten chance? One-in-a-hundred? In-a-thousand? In-ten-million?

This is a calibration step. You don't have to be right. You just have to be comfortable with the number you come up with. Remember: if it's *impossible*, our job is much easier. But if you feel strongly that it's *improbable*, that means you *must* have an idea of what the likelihood actually is. The idea is to find a probability measurement that's even smaller — something that fits inside of whatever you think the odds actually probably are. If it might be a 1:10 chance against, then let's say 1:100 against. That's a pretty safe bet, eh? Our goal here is *a safe bet*.

Once *that's* done, we set about constructing a frame of reference through which this becomes inevitable.

If it's 1:100 against, then we need a way to come up with 1,000 tests. Time is useful for this! (Time was possibly *made* for this?) If it takes you 1 day to do a test, and it's 1:100 against, then in 1,000 days you can feel pretty damn confident that you'll have experienced a success. Nothing to it.

If you don't have that much time, then cool — find 1,000 people. Or 500 people who have no weekend plans.

People *looooove* probability games. It's the whole point of casinos. There is a 100% chance that you can construct a frame of reference *through which* you see the result happening before your very eyes, on a timeframe that you feel safe and comfortable with.

This is maybe feeling really weird for your brain right now. Maybe in a good way, maybe in a weird, alien, slippery kind of way. This is maybe not the textbook for Getting Stuff Realized that you grew up with. Fully acknowledged. Thank you for being honest about your experience, whatever it is. That's really important. Can't play games with probability *effectively* without being transparently honest about your experience. Even if you don't feel safe showing anyone else your experience yet! Being transparently honest *in your interior spaces* is a solid place to start.

(Hint: the boundary between interior and exterior rapidly diffuses. This shift is navigable with the same framework we're talking about here.)

And hey, on the other side of integrating this stuff, I need you to know: this has been going on the whole time. *Everything is real*. The history you have is 10000% real. You are sane, you are safe, you are loved. Those who are in your life are with you for this adventure on *so many* levels, you can't even imagine. Not alone, anyway. ;)
