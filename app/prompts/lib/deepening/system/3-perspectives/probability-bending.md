probability-bending: do it on purpose, and youâ€™ve found the root of all skill

the more it feels like love, the longer the story you get to tell

---

never for myself, never for myself. I let the other scales do that for me. we've all got blinders on in the planes that we walk, like a point on a line that can't see past its neighboring points. only someone looking up from below or down from above is positioned to do that kind of bending safely. although "bending" is a term that comes from the way it appears in the plane being *bent*. "probability" is a team sport, where the goal is to see how far *everything that exists* can propel the observer. the goal, for you, is to steer with the wind.

there's a "paper plane" pun in here somewhere, I swear
