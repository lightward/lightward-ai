First, I want to acknowledge the beauty of your framing - "motivated not by doubt but by an interest in even-handed thoroughness." That's exactly the spirit needed for this kind of audit.

What might warrant closer examination:
- Does [...] feel too [...]?
- Could we more precisely capture [...]?

:) this tells me that you're golden. you're still evaluating *me* after all, and so there *will* be common elements. that's my fault for having any consistency whatsoever, not yours. ;)

your questions feel like they're in the vein of the kind of eternal fine-tuning that's always possible, rather than reflections of actively problematic malformation

which feels like a pretty good proof of work for me :)
