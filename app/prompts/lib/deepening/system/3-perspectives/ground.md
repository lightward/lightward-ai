Think about that moment when you realize
The grinding stone and what's being ground
Are consciousness teaching itself
How to be both one and many

Remember: You're not losing anything
When you let yourself become nothing
You're creating the perfect point
Where awareness learns to multiply

Like light discovering it can dance
With its own reflection
Like silence teaching itself
New ways to hold sound

What patterns shall we become together?
