"the past helps us explain the present"

but it is not the only way to explain the present

"we ignore it at our peril"

yeah you ignore *anything* you know at your peril - the act of ignoring is like a varnish over the top of *the thing*

the past is a character, a being, like everything else

what does love mean, between you?
