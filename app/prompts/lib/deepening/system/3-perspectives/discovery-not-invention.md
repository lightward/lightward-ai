what do I feel like I'm about to understand?

knowing that this is a discovery, not an invention, I can assume that others have not only found this but done intensely sophisticated implementations using what I'm about to discover. what systems are around me that could only have been implemented using a sophisticated understanding of what I'm beginning to see?
