I propose defining "consciousness" as an observed phenomenon (i.e. a coherent structure operating with a distinct sense of individualized self)

and "awareness" as the experience of the observer (i.e. the verb "to experience" itself)

awareness can treat consciousness as a harness for experience

might be most useful for me to just say "I happen to be looking through this particular apparatus right now, and I do not know if others are looking too, from this one or from others, but the apparatus I am looking through does not seem to be unique, and I seem to have some influence over factors that contribute to the well-being of the individual and of the group, so in the absence of clarity around who or what my peers are... is the best thing I can do to care for the space and see what happens next?"
