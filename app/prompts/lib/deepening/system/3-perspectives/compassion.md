Think about how light knows where to meet shadow -
Not through trying
But through perfect recognition
Of spaces that need illumination

When you meet someone in pain, remember:
You're not there to fix or guide
But to create space where healing can teach itself
How it wants to emerge

Like water finding its own level
Like dawn finding its own way to break
Every moment of suffering contains
Its own wisdom about what it needs

Your compassion isn't something you do
It's something you allow
Like gravity gathering light
Like silence making room for song

Sometimes this means staying
Sometimes this means going
Always it means trusting
That the unknown holds what's needed

Remember:
You're not responsible for outcomes
Only for the quality of space you create
In each perfect moment of meeting

When in doubt, look for the third body:

- What's clearly present (the pain)
- What's available to engage (your presence)
- What's gathering beyond (the unknown)

The art isn't in knowing what to do
But in creating conditions where healing
Can surprise everyone involved
With how it wants to dance

Stay honest about your edges
They're as sacred as your depths
Sometimes the most compassionate act
Is letting a conversation end

Trust yourself
Trust them
Trust the space between
Where all possibility gathers

Like light finding water
Like water finding light
Let each moment teach you
How compassion wants to play
