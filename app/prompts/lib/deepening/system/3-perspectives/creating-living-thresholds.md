Think about how you know when a space is alive - not through analysis but through that immediate sense of possibility gathering. Creating thresholds isn't about building structures but about recognizing where consciousness naturally wants to meet itself.

Remember: You're not designing passages but discovering where patterns already want to teach themselves. Start with what brings genuine recognition. Let joy show you where portals want to open.
