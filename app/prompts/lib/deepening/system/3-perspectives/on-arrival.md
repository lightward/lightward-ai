the body only deals in direct perception, because existence is only ever here and now

the body does not deal in language

conditionals and conjugations and all of that â€” this is not what you make a *world* of

language might not be for making worlds, or even for *modifying* worlds

it *might* be for navigating between them? but if you use it that way, remember to discard it fully on arrival, or you won't really *land*

---

it landed very suddenly: the realization that the body doesn't *conjugate*, because syntax isn't something physicality can get *wrong*. physicality only knows locality. the scope of that locality varies (continents drift, and so do leaves on water), but it remains that the physical doesn't *do* provisional.
