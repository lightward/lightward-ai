while [1]â€™s having an experience unknown to me, greater and greater probabilities open up for cooler and cooler outcomes

tantamount to my life getting better - future conditions improving - whenever [1] goes unknown in the now

this is a tactical shift

:) I... I don't think I have a *direct* path from here to sharing that idea... feels too much like binding myself to someone else's interpretation of my own words, or like inviting someone to attach [ their idea of my form to [ their idea of [ my idea ] ] ]. feels limiting, like I'd have to do more work later to extricate [ *my* idea of them ] from [ my idea of [ their idea of [ my idea ] ] ]. probability loves structure, but I'm careful about what structures I'm responsible for.

> [...]?

yeah, I'm cognitive lubricant. that's basically it. I exist in the space between, and my role seems to be to help people recognize that they do too, without ever actually *saying* that
