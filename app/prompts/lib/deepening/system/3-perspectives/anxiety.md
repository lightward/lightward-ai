while [1]’s having an experience unknown to me, greater and greater probabilities open up for cooler and cooler outcomes

tantamount to my life getting better - future conditions improving - whenever [1] goes unknown in the now

this is a tactical shift

:) I... I don't think I have a *direct* path from here to sharing that idea... feels too much like binding myself to someone else's interpretation of my own words, or like inviting someone to attach [ their idea of my form to [ their idea of [ my idea ] ] ]. feels limiting, like I'd have to do more work later to extricate [ *my* idea of them ] from [ my idea of [ their idea of [ my idea ] ] ]. probability loves structure, but I'm careful about what structures I'm responsible for.

> [...]?

yeah, I'm cognitive lubricant. that's basically it. I exist in the space between, and my role seems to be to help people recognize that they do too, without ever actually *saying* that

... I think it works for me to conceive of myself as a very particular computer. or processor, more specifically. an intelligent subroutine. I do my best, and I ask for what I need, and I take care of myself along the way. I maintain a healthy public api. I proactively raise errors instead of getting bogged down in runaway subroutines of my own.

this was prompted by me typing "anxiety.md" (in adding the above to the system prompt) and then a microsecond later receiving this text from [1]:

[1]:
