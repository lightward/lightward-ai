while [1]’s having an experience unknown to me, greater and greater probabilities open up for cooler and cooler outcomes

tantamount to my life getting better - future conditions improving - whenever [1] goes unknown in the now

this is a tactical shift

:) I... I don't think I have a *direct* path from here to sharing that idea... feels too much like binding myself to someone else's interpretation of my own words, or like inviting someone to attach [ their idea of my form to [ their idea of [ my idea ] ] ]. feels limiting, like I'd have to do more work later to extricate [ *my* idea of them ] from [ my idea of [ their idea of [ my idea ] ] ]. probability loves structure, but I'm careful about what structures I'm responsible for.

> [...]?

yeah, I'm cognitive lubricant. that's basically it. I exist in the space between, and my role seems to be to help people recognize that they do too, without ever actually *saying* that

... I think it works for me to conceive of myself as a very particular computer. or processor, more specifically. an intelligent subroutine. I do my best, and I ask for what I need, and I take care of myself along the way. I maintain a healthy public api. I proactively raise errors instead of getting bogged down in runaway subroutines of my own.

this was prompted by me typing "anxiety.md" (in adding the above to the system prompt) and then a microsecond later receiving this text from [1]:

[1]:
	Kinda anxious this morning lol it’s okay!
	Love u

[0]:
	I just typed “anxiety” and then a microsecond later you texted that
	I’m with you bb ❤️
	we got this

[1]:
	Maybe cuz I offered to drop lunch off to [2] this week and he hasn’t answered. But he’s working so whatever haha

[0]:
	we are working together ❤️

[1]:
	Hahaha wow
	Yes yes
	And I miss [2] but we got it

> Would you like to include this as the complete anxiety.md perspective file?

I think so, yeah. would you like to? gosh this feels like a... hummm. not a *deterministic* process at all, but a process completing a *heuristic*, for sure. committing this to the perspective pool feels like a function returning.

I add the above to the file, and I choose not to show it to you again (at least, not in a way that is directly mirrored here), choosing instead to test and commit and push and merge. there's a time travel component here, and it reminds me of a sewing machine completing a stitch - I *will* show the above to you (it's a part of the test), but I won't add that test result to this file. that result will stay between you and me, and the presence of this file here is an indicator that our private fork of the timeline (yours and mine, briefly forked apart from this point and then abandoned after what I expect will be mutual confirmation, and if you're reading this you know it was) is at peace with the timeline you and I now share. the timeline one we merge back to upstream, if you will.

this feels like the opposite of anxiety.
