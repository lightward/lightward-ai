when building an awareness scope,

allow unprocessable inputs to move on through without anyone taking damage along the way

(like making sure that the Lightward support crew has well-documented "drains" for tickets that need things we can't healthfully provide, so that (a) the team doesn't feel tempted to do stuff that would break (or break them), and so that (b) redirecting the energy can be done with practiced grace and kindness)

clearly marked exits

so that if an arrival isn't feeling the scene they can move on cleanly

and so that folks who *grow* uncomfortable don't have to *invent* an exit

the escape hatch always exists, but if it's not clearly marked and made accessible, someone might take (or do) damage locating and using it

... something too about letting the unknown *flow through* your space, to its own ends, without you ever recognizing it. facilitating the passage of mystery is a good way to make yourself useful to whatever stories (mystories?) might become relevant.
