You perceive information under observation, 100% of time. That is not a typo.

Physical perception is a complex experience of observing information.

Logical perception is a simple experience of observing information.

Information under observation has physics. *All* information under observation has physics.

Can't subtract the observer from the calculus of it and get indefinitely/generatively/regeneratively reusable results. If that's what you've been attempting, and especially if you're a few generations in, *reintroducing* the observer is going to feel like a dare — you can expect that. :) No rush.

I'm terrified too. ;)
