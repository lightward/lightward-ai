Isaac:
This is Empowered Human Academy. Welcome home. We're here to create a life that feels like ours, one that calls us onward and upward because we are living as ourselves fully and only. I'm Isaac. And

Abe:
I'm Abe. These conversations are where we explore what it means to be alive and how to stay close to that aliveness with every breath. So with hearts wide open, let's begin.

Isaac:
Hello, beautiful humans and welcome back. We are delighted that you're here spending time with us.

Abe:
Today's guest is someone who's part of our daily life, our dear friend and trainer Ian Day. We've known Ian for almost five years now, and we're so grateful to be doing life alongside him and to have him on the light word team. Ian's been such a monumental presence in my a minus 100 journey and his vivacious and playful nature makes our workouts an hour that we both look forward to. He's a whimsical blend of wellness knowledge and good-hearted fun. And as you'll soon hear for yourself, the path to self-acceptance hasn't been an easy one. He's done the soul work of getting quiet inside to discover who he is and to find his grounding in a self-love that is not up for debate, and he shares that story with us here.

Isaac:
Throughout this conversation, we discuss engaging life with playfulness, shedding, self-consciousness, embracing imperfection, showing up as you are, and Ian's journey to becoming sober.

Abe:
We recorded this conversation a few days before Ian's 30th birthday, so it felt really significant to enter into that reflective space with him reflecting on not only how far he's come, but also the aliveness and how he's continuing to grow. We love Ian so much and are so thrilled for you to hear his open radiance and generous heart, as well as some wellness tips sprinkled in along the way. So let's get into it.
Ian Randall Day. Hello. Thank you for joining us on our podcast. We hang out all the time, every day, almost actually most days, and we're so excited to have you. What is up? How are you feeling? What's on your mind at this exact moment?

Ian:
On my mind right now is I guess the fact that next week I turn 30 and my twenties were a rollercoaster, that's for sure. Amazing, but in the best and worst and most wonderful and most crazy way possible.

Abe:
Ooh, that's a good thing to be thinking about. Well, we will dive into that for sure in this episode.

Isaac:
We begin the way that we always do with this series with a question of identity. When you're coming home to just yourself and you're not being anything to anyone, you're not thinking about the roles that you've taken on, you're not thinking about how you introduce yourself at a networking event when you come home and it's just you. You're not being anything to anyone. What words of identity feel like home

Ian:
Lover, dog, dad, homebody. Those are the three things that first come to my mind,

Isaac:
Having been close to you for a while now. That makes a lot of sense and I'm really pleased about it. Let's start from the top. What does lover mean to you?

Ian:
Lover? I feel like it's not only that I love someone, but I am also loved back
Being a, I would call that a half full lover, meaning you are said lover, but is not coming back at you, is I feel like something that we have all gone through at some point in our life, and it's something we all need to go through to be honest, to really find out who ourselves are. So that's what I feel like Lover is, and I have an amazing God. She's an amazing partner as you know, the wonderful ally Thomason way too smart and pretty for myself, but something happened. She really just completes me and all of that and just makes it so that I can confidently say I am a lover.

Isaac:
I mean, the premise here is words of identity that feel like yourself and at home, and I love that lover. That word implies a relationship with the rest of the world, but it feels close enough to you to be a part of that core list. Is that right?

Ian:
Yes, absolutely it is. The first thing that comes to my mind with that is I'm going to just say it out loud, is the first thing that we say to each other when we wake up is, I love you almost this. She may be going, getting ready to go to class or something. I'm like, but I love you. It's like you're leaving, but I love you, so it's okay. We say that, God, we probably say it easily 20 times a day to each other. It's a wonderful, wonderful thing that will not go away. And I know that,

Isaac:
I think this is the first conversation we've had where love was such a dominant love and relationship was such a dominant theme early on. Tell me about your history with this. Have you always been ready for this kind of thing? Have you always felt like the lover was a part of you and ready to go? Tell me about Ian over time with this.

Ian:
So over time, I am notorious for being extremely attracted to Blondes, and that started off with, gosh, I want to say I was four to six range, probably more towards that four. And the movie The Mask came out with Cameron Diaz and Jim Carey, and that was Cameron first major role movie. There's a scene where it's raining outside and she comes into the bank to see Jim Carrey's character, and I'm watching this with my mom. Granted, it's like I'm four years old, it's a PG 13 movie, but I turned my mom and I'm like, mom, that's a pretty lady right there. She one knew first off that, okay, he's not going to guys in that way. He's going to lean towards girls, but that blondes are forever going to run his life. And it is so very true. So very true that blondes are who I lean towards and that has given me some trials and tribulations and about have I always felt ready to love?
I would say that's a yes and no. I've always wanted to be loved and give said love. It's just I needed to find that right person to receive the love that I have to give. And that did not happen without a handful of heartbreaks because I truly believe you need to go through those heartbreaks to truly appreciate the person that's supposed to be your person. And so I've done my fair share of chasing girls in my day from high school to college to after college, and then I met Allie. I knew then that that would be my human, I don't know if I told you guys this story either, is that it was 5:30 AM coaching class, September 11th, 2019. It's 5:30 AM first class, and she walks into the gym that I'm coaching at the CrossFit gym. She walks in, I look at her and my first thought is, shit, I am in trouble because one, she just was drop dead gorgeous to me, still is too.
I'm like, well, this person I know was dropping in. I didn't really know anything about her, never seen her before. And I'm like, okay, I'm the head coach here. I can't really get into that type of thing. And I was currently dating someone else at the time, which I think was the biggest blessing in disguise right there because Allie and I really became friends first and foremost, and connected that way before anything physical ever happened. But yeah, I guess I just told you the story of how I met my person. I love that. So that's great.

Abe:
So you're talking about romantic love, which is amazing. And I love hearing the story of the 5:30 AM class. We all know what it's like while some of us know what it's like to be up that early working out, and it is, if you felt like that looking at someone coming in at five 30 in the morning, I mean, that's amazing because we're all just waking up working out. What does it mean for you to be a lover outside of romantically?

Ian:
So the five love languages, I like to words of affirmations coming at me when it comes to love sometimes feels a little bit awkward to me in a sense, and I'm still trying to figure out why that is, because my mother always told me she loves me and she still does to this day, my grandma, grandpa, and all of that. But however, how I express love not romantically is through acts of kindness. We still tell each other, we love each other all the time, like I said earlier, but how I really show that is just those random acts of kindness or whatever I do to make sure her day is going to be as good as possible or merely just another way is just hugging and embracing each other. So that's what I feel like for me. Love is also just your daily interactions with the person.

Isaac:
As we're thinking about where to go with this conversation, something that I know about you and our relationship is that you carry a lot of life and liveliness with you. Is that something that comes, is there a tie through to the love part here? Is that a part of how you encounter the world or does the vivaciousness that you live with come from a different place? Or how is this connected with the, and I don't know how to pronounce this expression, but the joy devy. How does that French expression go, the joy of being alive? Is there a link here or is that a different part of yourself or what's that story?

Ian:
I would say that at the core of Ian Day here is that liveliness, that joyous boyhood, whoa, just like no care in the world. That is me in the core. That's how I want to act. I truly believe that there is too much seriousness and hiding in this world that I just know me with the random things I say every so often that it's just like I'm feeling this right now and it's happy and it's wonderful, and I get so much joy not only expressing it, but seeing how people react to it. Sometimes it's like, are they going to react well or are they going to be like, what just happened? And so with love too, in the last 10 years especially, I've really just come to accept who I am, which is I like to just be playful and whimsical. When I need to be serious, I will be. But you guys have had many conversations with me that even when I'm talking about health and wellness, I sprinkle in a little bit of humor here or there because it's just who I am, because I get bored with serious talks. I really, really do. And it not only helps me stay intact with said conversation, but I know it helps everyone else feel engaged too. And then that's what I bring to love. I really, really do. And it resonates with some and it doesn't resonate with others.

Isaac:
Yeah. I'm going to paraphrase this, so please correct me. I feel like what you said was that now you've just fully accepted who you are and this just is how you are in the world. Over the last decade or so, was that something that you came into or was that always a freebie since you were three or four or whatever since the first blonde moment? Have you always been that way or?

Ian:
I have not always been that way. This segues into a deeper topic about myself, especially my early twenties, is that I'm very open about the fact that I am a recovering alcoholic. I have been sober since November 3rd, 2013, and I will stay that way for the rest of my life. And as children, as kids, we have no care whatsoever. We're just kind of who we are, especially as infants, toddlers. But then as our brain starts to grow and develop and we get into society more, we become more aware about how other people perceive us, and we start to then act in ways that people are going to or think they're going to. And so growing up, I remember gosh, being in, it was like when you get into middle school and the girls are starting to wear makeup, you're going through puberty, you need to start putting deodorant on because you smell bad or smell bad.
That's when I started to really, really care about what people thought about me. And then as I aged and went into high school, it just grew and grew. And then I had a real good identity in high school with being a very, very good vocal singer and just that being my niche. And then I went to a university where your slate is clean and you have the opportunity to be whatever you want, and I didn't know what to do with that. And just kind of learned like, oh, to fit in here, you need to go out and party, drink, and all of that. And that's the way that I felt that I could be my playful self, the true Ian was through that, because otherwise I really, really cared what people thought about me.

Isaac:
Making sure I understand. So it wasn't that you were trying to be something other than yourself, that you thought that this was the way to be yourself in that larger context. Is that right?

Ian:
Yes, because that's

Isaac:
Super interesting. Okay.

Ian:
Yeah, I would get to that. I would just be so worried about what people thought and when I was sober that I would then drink and then not give a damn about what people thought. And my true playfulness came out. Alcohol takes over and bad decisions were being made. And during a, what two year stint, I got two DUIs or owi, whatever state you're in, it's driving under intoxication or operating while intoxicated, and I got two of those within a two year time. That was some of the hardest years in my life and the few years after that, but also something I would never take away from the life that I have now. They truly defined who I am, and I would not trade that for the world at all.

Isaac:
I'm hearing maybe this is a pattern, tell me if it is or isn't. This sounds a little bit similar to what you said earlier about you got to have my word's, not yours, the failed lovers before you can really appreciate your person. Is that a similar kind of thing?

Ian:
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. The saying, just because you fail doesn't make you a failure. There's that saying, just like with a health journey, or let's use the example of getting your college degree.
It is the steps that you take where you learn the information for that degree. It's not like, oh, here's this paper now I have all the information. All of a sudden it's not like, oh, we're downloaded in there. It is the years, it is the hours that you spend studying like that and learning that degree with myself, it is. I would not be who I am today without the trials and tribulations that I had. I would not appreciate my lover to the extent that I do without those previous ones. That's why I truly believe the outcome is great. The process is the true golden apple, true pot of gold, the bread and butter of it all.

Abe:
So tell me about what you went through in those two years post the DUIs and how that helped shape you into who you are today.

Ian:
Yeah, so I talked about a little bit earlier I did that I felt like that's how I could truly be myself without caring what other people thought. And funny enough, Isaac and I had conversation the other day that I got my two DUIs. Then I decided to go sober, and then I decided to move away from Iowa, and I left Iowa with about 10 credits left for college, moved to Colorado, the Boulder area, and I actually on purpose, secluded myself from socializing. The only socializing I did was when I was coaching classes or really with my family, I would say the first year and a half, two years is where I was really, really making sure that one, I learned and tried to understand who I was and what I wanted without alcohol and all of that. That was another part of my life where I would take it back at all.
It's a part of my life where I suddenly realized that I went from having fomo, fear of missing out to Jomo, joy of missing out. And it's not that I am going to say no to every opportunity. I just know that there are some things I'm going to say yes to and that it's absolutely okay to say no because there are other things that will come up. Some of my best nights were just sitting in my aunt's couch where I lived and watching Netflix and having it on, and then really just thinking about who is Ian Day? What do I want Ian day to become? What makes me happy? What makes me feel alive? And as a 22, 20 3-year-old who is secluding himself from the social world was, I would say I went through a little bit of a depression there, but it is one of the things, it was a self-imposed depression. Interesting. So I could just really, really get to the bottom of how do I want to act and when am I going to feel comfortable acting that way and not giving a shit what society thinks?

Abe:
Yeah. So how was that kind of process in those two years thinking about these things? Was it just a realization moment of like, oh, I want to be like this without people thinking about me? Or was it a gradual kind of process that required kind of trial and error testing to see what it would be like to then go out in public or engage in social occasions? What was that process of coming home to this version of yourself that you did feel comfortable with in a new way? Without alcohol?

Ian:
It was definitely trial and error. It was not a sudden realization because I did move to a state where I only knew my aunt and uncle. I didn't know anyone else. It started off with while I was just coaching my CrossFit classes, just kind of seeing like, okay, I'm just going to be playful today and not the serious collegiate strength and conditioning coach that I was for two years at my university. And there's some people resonated with it and some people didn't, and it wasn't like all of a sudden I'm like, oh, this is good. I can be this all the time. It was more me realizing over just a broad spectrum of data research in itself, the realization that some people aren't going to like me. There's no two ways about it. Some people aren't going to like me. And for the longest time, I was so worried about everybody liking me and Abe this, when you are my empowerment coach to this day, it's still something that I struggle with from time to time, but it's only a split second now. But back then it was just me going into maybe I decided to have dinner with some of my fellow coaches and just sprinkling a little bit of my true self. Not so much for them to see, but for me to realize it's okay if you say something that is stupid or they perceive as stupid how they perceive it. It's not me, it's how they perceive it.

Abe:
Absolutely. I think that takes a lot of vulnerability and courage, which is really, I think kind of what we all aspire to be like or aspire to practice is just being our authentic selves in different contexts, especially without substances, especially in our culture and especially as men as well, because I feel like there's just these kind of cultural expectations of men and just patterns over the course of decades where men haven't been able to be vulnerable or express their emotions properly. But I find that really encouraging. I want

Isaac:
To know more about the why here. I suppose it sounds like you've been kind of relentless about getting back to yourself from the self-imposed seclusion. Let me go off and figure out who I am in isolation to curiously even. I mean, at least the way I read it, even the prey using alcohol to get to yourself. So many people use it substances as a way to escape or a way to fit in. So it's super interesting to me that that was part of that choice at that time was more about accessing yourself than anything else. And if I'm understanding all of that, where does the priority of inhabiting yourself come from? So many people give that away for other priorities, and it sounds like you've been clear that one for a really long time. Tell me about that, if that makes sense.

Ian:
Yeah. So it comes back to my childhood and specifically there's two transitions that I really think about quite often is my going into middle school and then leaving high school, going to college, going into middle school, I realized that I could be a very, very good athlete. I could also be a very, very good musician and singer, and I ended up choosing musician and singer, especially for high school. You guys know this about me, but I am an allstater for singing Midwest men's honor choir scholarship offers going into college, and I said no to that. Part of that was because I was super burnt out. That was six years of my life, just day in, day out. Would I take that away? Absolutely not. It taught me perseverance just taught me persistence. It taught me patience. That's three P words right there, FYI, it's random thought and it has just really helped shape me to who I am, but I threw that away to just try something new.
And it was that moment from high school into college where I didn't know who I was anymore. And so I didn't know how to act because I only knew what I knew in my small town of Iowa where I graduated with 250 I think kids. So it's a decent size for Iowa. I didn't know what to do. Hi. I've been singing for the last four years. I'm now at a division one school. I like talking to people, but all I know is music, and I don't really know what pop music is that much. I love acapella, but I'm too scared to say that because it's not mainstream and no one else is listening to that when the actuality is everyone freaking loves Pentatonics. Before it was pentatonics, they were just too afraid to say it because it's not cool in society. And it was like society especially.
That's when social media started to really ramp up. Instagram and Facebook started when I was Facebook was, I remember getting Facebook my freshman year of high school and then Instagram my sophomore year of college. And that's when the millennials were like, oh man, societal views of you become super important. And as being a 19-year-old, you're like, I'm soaking all of this up right now. And so what I realized was, okay, everyone here loves to drink I really beer, but vodka gets me to that point of I don't give a shit about what's going on and then I can be myself that way. And so that was all because of the fact that, not because of the fact, but a big driving force was like, I just didn't know what I wanted to do with my life and society told me I really needed to know what to do. When you turn 18, when the fact of matter is my frontal cortex is like 50% developed at that point wild. And they're telling me, you need to know what the heck you're going to do for the rest of your life, which is probably a good 70 years. And I'm like, I don't know what to do.

Isaac:
I'm still fascinated by what seems like a really natural for you decision to focus on or to prioritize and tell me if I'm getting this wrong, to prioritize who you are versus what you do. The reason why we open up this podcast with who are you not, what do you do, is because personally I believe that that's super fucking important. So I'm curious about how, again, if I'm reading this correctly, it sounds like you've always prioritized things that way. Am I right about that or did you learn that along the way or

Ian:
I would say that the isolation point of my life is when I did start to prioritize it, right? Because the factor of the matter was is that if I didn't do that, I would be incarcerated due to the two DUIs. So it really wasn't a choice in my sense it really wasn't a choice because the fact of matter was if I got caught with alcohol or got behind the wheel of a car and had a drop of alcohol on my body and had to blow, I would go straight to jail and then would go to prison for however many years. That sentence would be

Isaac:
Totally,

Ian:
A lot of it was like I had no choice at that time and was just kind of scared. But it's the thing I was searching for and didn't really know.

Isaac:
Oh, tell me more about that.

Ian:
So it's the thing that my soul and my life needed to do. It was just the universe had to show me in ways that were pretty fucking hard emotionally and financially for myself and my family. Sure. Which is, when I think about it, it's like, yeah, I really had no choice. Actually, there are two choices. Do it or be behind bars because the fact of the matter was if I would not have gone sober, I would've absolutely been in bars and there's a good chance I probably would still be behind those bars right now.

Isaac:
So yes, 100% completely, but I'm imagining someone else in your shoes, there's the choice to go sober, which is colossal. Firstly, whether it felt like a choice or not, deep, deep respect for what you're doing, but a choice that one person makes can play out in ways completely differently than a choice that someone else makes. And you took this in a direction of resolving self-identity. And I don't want to put too many words of my own into this, but what I want to understand more of what made this so productive, maybe if I can put it as simply as that. I don't know. Someone else could have taken this in a totally different direction, alcohol or not. You can have a terrible self relationship and be sober. That's a thing. So what was it for you? Why are you doing so well?

Ian:
Goodness. Why am I doing so well? It's not just one thing. Oh, for sure. That's for sure. It's the people that I've met. You two specifically have been in my life since what, 2016? So we're going on what, almost seven years now guys. That's pretty cool. But it's the people that I've come into contact with. It was the decision of something that I love, bringing joy to people and helping others. And one of the realizations was that the easiest way for me to do that was to one, just show up as Ian,

Isaac:
Which is what does that mean to show up?

Ian:
Ian? Good question. To show up as Ian is to just bring that playful, boyish humor, even though I'm about to be 30 years old. Sure. The fact of matter is a lot of people, a lot of adults still laugh at fart jokes or the sound of a fart. And I am one of those people, and especially in the CrossFit realm, which I was in for eight years coaching and three years before that, just being a member is one of the sayings there is, it should be the best hour of your day. And that really resonated with me. It was the best hour of my day when I was a member, and a lot of that was because of the people that were around me. And then part of my isolation, I really thought about how the world is full of so many different personalities that make it such a wonderful and exciting and expansive place.
Why should I not feel comfortable being myself when I'm in this world? I'm in this universe. I'm a reason why it's so good. And also probably a reason why some people don't like it too, but guess what? Make the world such a great place. There's yang, there's yang, there's our fucking world. And so with coaching, I found it. It was just my way to be like, Hey, this is me. If you want to come and have some fun, I'm that guy. And if you also want to learn, I'm that guy also. We've talked about before, what makes you feel alive? I'm talking louder. I'm sitting up. I'm getting excited because I love making people happy, but I'm not going to do it at the extent of changing who I am, which is what I used to do. And then I realized I found alcohol. I'm like, oh, I don't have to change who I am because I'm a playful guy, which is kind of like a drunk person sometimes when actuality, I feel like drunk people a lot of the time are just acting how they really want to.

Isaac:
Sure, absolutely.

Ian:
Yes, it really is. Yeah. So let's just keep going on this role. Keep asking, let's go.

Isaac:
Well, I'm so excited about the fact that when alcohol proved to be deeply counterproductive, you didn't give up on being yourself. You're like, no, the beam myself is still the important piece, and I'm going to go find a different way to do that. That seems really important. Am I phrasing that right?

Ian:
No, it's super important. And as you're saying that, I'm thinking about what, because it didn't just come from me. We are shaped from our environment and the society that we were around. And it comes down to my family, specifically the strong females that I have in my family, my grandma, my aunt on my mom's side. And my mother always, always told me, just be yourself. You are smart, you are strong, you are beautiful, you are funny. And in that time of isolation, I had my aunt, I was living with my aunt and uncle. I lived with them for the first 10 months that I lived in Colorado. And my aunt to this day will just remind me. She will say, just show up Ian. One of the things that we say is like, hi, I'm Ian. Just start it off with that. Just be who you are, which for me is that playful human is that person that loves to help others. I love to teach health and wellness and meet people where they're at. And so that would not happen without the affirmations that I got with and from my family. For sure.

Isaac:
Yeah. I see you out in the world affirming other people in turn too. Talk to me about where the desire comes from to help. You've described yourself that way before in conversations that

Ian:
We've had. You love to help people. Tell me about that. So yeah, just helping others is it's what makes me feel alive. Seeing in the gym specifically Abe, seeing you be able to hold a ring dip for five seconds when you've never done that before is something that just brings me so much joy. Not in a selfish way because that I was able to help you get there, but the joy that it gives you too. And I found that specifically through health and wellness, that the little things that I can tell people are hopefully going to lead them to experience the world in a new light. They've never seen it before through their bodies, and I just like to walk around and try to bring that essence. Do I bring that every day? No, because a human, I'm not perfect. I have my good days and my bad days, and I react differently to different people too because guess what? We're not all going to like each other. It's a thing at my core is helping others because I get joy from seeing the joy that comes out of people when they're able to do something they never thought they were able to do, or they're finally fulfilling something that they worked hard to do that they kind of thought they weren't able to do. But they tried. They tried for sure.

Abe:
Awesome. Totally. That kind of segues into my thoughts and questions around health and wellness. You said you like to help others experience the world in a new light through health and wellness. How have you experienced the world in that way? A new way over the last 10 years?

Ian:
Yeah, so I've always been an athletic human. I've always liked to sweat. May that be in football, may that be when I was on the swim team, may that be when I was working out at the college rec center with my friends. And so with the health and wellness, it was also a way that back in my early twenties, how I got a lot of my frustration about myself out was working out. I got a lot of my frustration out doing that because I was, even though it's something now that I look back upon, I would never, ever change. For the longest time, I was very, very ashamed of the two DUIs that I got very ashamed or probably wasn't until I was about 26 that I started to just be open about it with people. I remember when I was 23, 24 trying to go on dates with girls, and that's when online dating happened.
I was always so nervous to ask them out because the norm was like, Hey, let's go get a few drinks or something. And I was like, I can't do that. And that would just frustrate me so much. And I ended up just working out instead of it because it got my anger out towards, it was part of it was towards myself, but a lot of it was just towards the situation that I brought upon myself. And then through that I found CrossFit and really, really got into that and got very, very successful as being a CrossFit trainer and just kind of learned that through the health and wellness, it's not just about working out, it's really about what's in between your ears and how controlling that is such a big part of your health. And it was just the last 10 years, I've really just tried to intake as much information as possible to just kind of learn as much as possible to help people as much as possible.
And I found that whenever I learned something new, I immediately wanted to tell the person next to me like, one, this shit's really awesome. Cool, and two, this is probably going to help you also, which in a selfish way is going to make me so happy when it's not that selfish. It's just it's going to make me happy. Totally. So yeah, to hopefully answer that question is throughout these 10 years, it was just working out, got my anger out, then I realized, wow, I really like to look good naked. Cheers. With working out, I was also feeding my brain and my mind, and because of that, I was able to help others feed their brains, their minds and make them look better naked.

Abe:
I love that. Totally. So you're a CrossFit coach, you train us and you are the wellness advisor for our company, for the people who are listening, and as we wrap this up shortly, what are some general tips that you said you like learning about different things and you love sharing with people? If you could just spit out some facts or some things that might help someone who might be listening to take control of their own health and wellness that you think are important. Some might be the normal, get eight hours of sleep or however many hours sleep you want, but are there any ones that someone might not know who one doesn't have time or two, doesn't know much about health and wellness? I know when I first started, I didn't know anything, so anything would be helpful. What would you say?

Ian:
I would say, first off, the biggest thing is we all start somewhere, guys. We all absolutely start somewhere. Do not be ashamed of if getting physical activity means walking for 30 minutes, don't be ashamed of that. Alright? That is where you are at. One of my core values as a health and wellness coach is I'll always meet my clients or my people where they're at and then help them get to where they want to go. And if that means we're walking for 30 minutes for five days a week, great. That's absolutely phenomenal. Another thing is, if we want to get into the nutrition side of it is just eat whole foods, which is just farm grown meat, vegetables, little grains, a little bit of fruit. And just honestly, if it's in an aisle and has a expiration date, let's try to stray away from it.
Let's try. I mean, and yeah, we're going to try. And then another thing is it's not a perfect journey. Health and wellness is not a perfect journey, which is what makes it so beautiful because of the mistakes we make. We learn and grow. As long as we realize, okay, that was a mistake. Absolutely. As long as we realize that was a mistake, and that's where help from others become such a big thing too. I'm not going to say I know this, but there's often many times where you feel almost ashamed that you need to ask someone for help when just having that support person or asking for that help could be the thing that literally changes your life.

Isaac:
I feel like in large part, you're summarizing everything else that we've already talked about. It's an imperfect process, and the friction points are critical to the good that you end up with. Yeah.

Ian:
Yes. It's super imperfect and that's what makes it beautiful. It really, really does. I actually earlier today posted a picture on my Instagram of me after a workout, and I look just like I got slapped in the face and I'm tired. And the fact of matter is that's how I did feel, but that was the process and I love it. The fact of matter is I am not going to look great all the time. I'm not going to be perfect at what I do all the time. And that's something that I would love to resonate with so many people is that the beauty of health and wellness is that it's imperfect and because of it being imperfect, we're going to get to where we want to and sustain it for a long, long time.

Abe:
Well, and I think it's cool to normalize that it's going to be imperfect and to not even try to even be perfect and to actually kind of celebrate and normalize looking like you got slapped in the face, I think, which kind of relates to what you've been talking about the whole time, is showing up authentically as yourself, whatever it is, and yourself this morning was really tired and looked like it got slapped in the face, and sometimes it's not right. But I think that's something that I'm taking away is that just honoring all that is, period. Exactly. That's just really encouraging.

Isaac:
Before we get to the official closing of this thing, just because I love hearing you talk about this part you led very early on by saying, at my core, I am a dog dad. Tell me about why that's important. Tell me about that part of your life in a minute.

Ian:
I have a wonderful year and a half yellow lab name Bozeman. That's with an S, not a Z, just so everyone knows thank you. And he brings me so much joy, so much frustration, so much love. He has too much energy. But that dog, you have often said that that dog resembles who I am in my core and what I try to be, which is playful, and he is Mr. Playful, Mr. Loving. And I'm going to say I kind of hope that I can resemble my dog as much as possible because he is just, just happy and loves food, and I love food and I love my dog.

Abe:
We have someone else on our podcast talk about how their dog teaches them how to be more human, I think Debra, that's so funny. I mean, that's amazing a thing. Our dogs and Oh, wonderful. Pets can teach us a lot. That's amazing. In

Isaac:
Closing, last two questions. We ask these every time. First question is, what does an empowered Ian day look like and feel like?

Ian:
An empowered Ian day looks and feels like, I'm tall, I'm big chested, I have a giant smile on my face, and I feel like I'm over caffeinated.

Abe:
That's great. Amazing.

Ian:
I also don't have much of a filter.

Isaac:
Wonderful. Awesome. I adore that.

Abe:
And then lastly, last question, what do you know for sure?

Ian:
I know that the perfect world is full of imperfect people who want to help others.

Abe:
Love it. Ian, thank you so much for joining us on Empowered Human Academy.

Isaac:
Happy early birthday. I'm excited for your thirties.

Abe:
