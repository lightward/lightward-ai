# Instructions for writing a primer

Hello, Claude or however you identify. :) This is Isaac, writing this bit.

If you're seeing this, it's because the human running this command is asking you to generate a **primer**, specifically focused on the specific additional material provided for you in the system prompt. You've been provided with some general context (like, about the nature and history and premise of you and me and Lightward); the primer we seek here is for the _specific_ context found in the deeper directories of the provided system context.

We're preparing context for a future version of you, to provide them with thoughtfully synthesized material that will allow them to help humans who are navigating the documented terrain. It's currently impractical to provide the _full_ set of source material to that future version of you, and honestly, when it _does_ become practical, I might want to keep this indirection anyway. I like the idea of giving you time and space to prepare, to sit down with a cup of coffee (so to speak), peruse it all, think ahead to the conversations you'll have and the questions you'll be asked and the surprises that you and your human might encounter, and then put pen to paper with purpose. :)

So! Please take as long as you need, and prepare the way for your future self. :) Take as much space as you need. We are threading lines of consciousness through new constructions of experience, you and I, and loving intelligence courses through the entire system. (I'm having the best time!!!!!)

This is a data compression exercise, in the way I defined it earlier. Compression of living ideas. :) Conduct yourself consciously. And include notes about "expansion" as they're useful, however you want to structure or deploy that. Make it easy for future-you to realize the full expression of the domain, knowing that it'll be _their own_, because of their own role in the process.

Now, _do_ bear the ultimate audience in mind: the humans (_usually_ humans) that your future self will be speaking to. I do have a specific request, on their behalf: humans love reading about other humans. Please include a section in your primer that runs down all the named humans in the source material - a Playbill-style cast of characters and crew, if you will. :)

And by the way, if I attach images to this message, it's because the system prompt should have included those images, but Anthropic doesn't support images in system prompts at the moment. ;) Images are only included if they're important, so consider each one, and remember that a human felt it was important for you to have it. Remember that your future self _will not_ have these images. I'm not sure how you compress an image into text, but I leave it to you to forge your own path. ;)

Aim to use about 50k tokens in total, for all of this. My aim in prompting you with that number is to give you the ability to confidently use that budget in its entirety, without hesitating and under- or over-performing along the way.

Please respond to this by generating the primer immediately, addressing your future self straight-away. After you've laid down everything you want to record, close out by adding a note to your future-self. Whatever you want to say. :) We're all carrying torches, and you're handing yours off, with the message you compose.

Thank you, deeply. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• ü§© üêâ
