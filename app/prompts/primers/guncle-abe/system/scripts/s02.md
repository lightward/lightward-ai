# GUNCLE ABE SEASON 2 

## EPISODE 1: FRUSTRATION 

**ABE:** When I was a kid, recess was my adventure time—a chance to hang out with friends, dream up amazing stories, and play! I always imagined the playground as a magical world, a place where I learned to shout out loud, be super brave, and most importantly, to celebrate being _me_! Are you ready to dive into a world full of fun, friends, and learning? Let's spark our imaginations and play along in my magical world where _everyone_ belongs. Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe—where every day is a rainbow-filled adventure!

Hello, Abe’s Amigos! Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe! I am SO happy you’re here. Wherever you are in the world right now, I hope you are having a MAGICAL day. Today is a GREAT day to feel great and BE great! I’m Guncle Abe—YouTube’s favorite guncle. I love learning about emotions and how to be confident, all while having fun with my amigos, which means “friends” in Spanish! Here at Recess, we’re going to LEARN! We’re going to DANCE! And we’re going to have FUN!

But before we dive in, let’s get grounded by practicing some breathing.

_(Now in classroom)_

Today, we’re going to learn how to breathe with our bellies. I’m going to show you how to do belly breathing and then invite you to try it with me. For this breathing practice, you can either lay down or sit up, it’s up to you—whatever feels comfiest.

First, place one hand on your belly and the other on your heart. We are going to pretend that our bellies are balloons. When I breathe in, I am going to fill up my belly with air, just like a balloon and watch my hand rise. _(Demonstrate)_

As I breathe out, I’ll let all of the air out of my balloon. _(Demonstrate)_

Now try it with me! Place one of your hands on your belly and one on your heart. Breathe in, fill your belly up with air, make a big balloon. Breathe out, slowly let all of the air out. _(Take a moment and demonstrate)_

Let's try it again. Breathe in, fill up your belly with air, make a big balloon. Breathe out, slowly let all of the air in your balloon go. _(Demonstrate)_

One more time! Breathe in, fill up your belly with air, make a big balloon. Breathe out, slowly let all of the air in your balloon go. That’s it! Thanks for trying belly breathing with me, I’m feeling more relaxed already!

Now that we’ve taken some deep breaths, it’s time for some LEARNING! My friends and I LOVE to learn, and today we’re going to talk about an emotion that starts with the letter F, and that emotion is _FRUSTRATION_.

My good friend and teacher extraordinaire, Miss Fanny, is going to come teach us all about it. Miss Fanny LOVES to teach me and my amigos about emotions. _(Miss Fanny appears)_ Hi Miss Fanny, I’m so happy to see you!

**MISS FANNY:** Well hello hello Guncle Abe! What a _fabulous_ day to learn more about the rainbow of emotions! Are you and your amigos ready to learn about frustration?

**ABE:** To be honest Miss Fanny, I’m feeling a little nervous, because frustration can be a harder thing to feel. But if learning about it might help me have more words for what I’m feeling, I really _do_ want to learn.

**MISS FANNY:** Guncle Abe, thank you for being honest with me! What you’re feeling is so understandable—frustration can be quite overwhelming. Does it make you feel any better to know that we’ll be learning together, that you’re not alone? I know that I _definitely_ feel frustrated sometimes.

**ABE:** Yes, Miss Fanny, that does make me feel better. I like the idea of learning together with you and the other amigos. Let’s do it. So let’s sit down, amigos, and learn all about FRUSTRATION!

**MISS FANNY:** Get comfortable my dear ones. Today we’re learning all about the word “frustration” because it starts with the letter F, the next letter in our alphabet of emotions. Frustration is what you might feel when things don’t go your way, or when there’s something blocking you from getting what you want. There’s a lot of different reasons why we might feel frustrated. Guncle Abe, why don’t we spell out some reasons for the amigos!

**ABE:** Absolutely! You might feel frustrated when someone else is playing with a toy of yours that you want and they won’t give it back, even when you ask nicely.

**MISS FANNY:** You also might feel frustrated when trying to solve a math problem in class, or when you’re trying to draw a picture but can’t get the lines to look the way you want them to!

**ABE:** Or when learning to tie your shoes! That can be _very_ frustrating.

**MISS FANNY:** Or when your sister or brother eats the last piece of Halloween candy that you’ve been saving for a special time! Oh dear!

**ABE:** _(to amigos)_ What about you, amigos? Can you remember a time when _you_ felt frustrated? Take a moment to think and then turn to the person next to you and tell them about it. We’ll take about ten seconds to do this, starting NOW!

_(Abe whispers his response to Miss Fanny while a musical interlude plays)_ **MISS FANNY:** Wonderful, just _wonderful_, everyone! I’m so proud of you all. We _all_ feel frustrated sometimes—but what we _can_ practice is learning to not take out our frustration on other people, like yelling or throwing things. Learning to be patient and wait our turn can actually make the times that we _do_ get what we want even more special! Think of frustration like a flashlight, it’s there to show you what’s important to you!

**ABE:** I love that, Miss Fanny. Thanks for teaching us about frustration! You are _such_ a good teacher! I can’t wait to see you next time and learn more about our emotions! Remember, amigos: next time you feel frustrated, take a _deep_ breath and remember that it’s ok to not get _everything_ you want _all_ the time, _exactly_ when you want it. Things don’t always go our way, and that’s A-ok!

**MISS FANNY:** An excellent reminder, Guncle Abe! My oh my, look at the time! I better be flying off for now! Goodbye, Guncle Abe! Goodbye amigos! I’ll be seeing youuuuuu! _(Miss Fanny disappears)_

**ABE:** Okay amigos, now it’s time to take a little break from learning to do one of my favorite things in the whole wide world—_DANCING_! Let’s hop on the Jolly Trolly to head to Disco Dance Hall where we’ll meet my friend, Rainbow Ray—the popstar of positive dancing!

_(Abe hops on Jolly Trolly)_

**ABE:** Hey, Rainbow Ray!! It’s SO good to see you!

**RAINBOW RAY:** Hi Guncle Abe! You got here just in time—I’ve been wanting to learn a new dance for our dance party, and now that you and your amigos are here, we can start the fun!

**ABE:** Rainbow Ray, the amigos and I just learned about frustration. Just out of curiosity, what do _you_ do whenever you feel frustrated?

**RAINBOW RAY:** You know, Guncle Abe, dancing is a GREAT thing to do when I feel frustrated. It helps me move around all that energy inside! Speaking of dancing, are you and the amigos ready to dance?!

**ABE:** Oh you bet we are, Rainbow Ray! Alright amigos, I’m going to teach you a dance for our dance party! But before we learn the moves, I want to tell you something very important, so listen closely. Disco Dance Hall is your space to express yourself and move exactly the way that feels good to you. If it feels better to wiggle, move your hands, or close your eyes and just listen to the music, this is where we accept ALL of who we are, whatever that looks like! This space is all about moving your body in a way that feels unique to YOU. Now, I’m going to show you the moves if you want to dance, so follow my instructions!

_(Abe shows kids dance number)_

**RAINBOW RAY:** Wow, I love these groovy moves! Let’s do this!

**ABE:** Alright amigos, are you ready?! 3, 2, 1—

**ABE & RAINBOW RAY:** _DANCE TIME!_

_(Dance party!)_

**ABE:** Wow, that was so much fun! Amigos, your dance moves are looking great out there! Thanks for dancing with us, Rainbow Ray! I _love_ being your friend—you help me to feel more like myself because I LOVE to dance and so do YOU! You remind me that accepting myself is important and also really fun!

**RAINBOW RAY:** I love being your friend too, Guncle Abe! And you’re right, I DO love to dance! It helps me move through my emotions and have SO MUCH FUN with my friends! I’m so happy you stopped by to dance with me!

**ABE:** We’ll come back soon for another dance party—bye for now, Ray!

**RAINBOW RAY**: I can’t even wait! Peace out, Guncle Abe! Bye amigos! Stay groovy! _(Rainbow Ray leaves)_

**ABE:** Alright amigos, how are you doing out there? We have one more stop left today, so let’s hop back on the Jolly Trolly and head to the Affirmation Station!

_(Abe rides to Affirmation Station)_

**ABE:** Next I want to introduce you to my friend Queenie, who teaches me how to love myself for exactly who I am. _(Queenie appears)_ Hi Queenie!

**QUEENIE:** Oh hello, sweet Guncle Abe! I’m absolutely _delighted_ that you’re here!

**ABE:** Queenie, today we learned about frustration—can you teach us an affirmation to  remember when we feel frustrated?

**QUEENIE:** Guncle Abe, I have just the thing! But before I share my affirmation with you, I want us all to find our crowns and tiaras and put them on, to remind us of how special we are.

_(Abe puts on his tiara.)_

**ABE:** What do you think of mine, Queenie?

**QUEENIE:** Oh it is simply _DIVINE_! You all are _glowing_! Now, here’s the affirmation, are you ready? We’ll do the affirmation in two parts, here’s the first: Good things are on their way to me…

**ABE:** Good things are on their way to me…

**QUEENIE: …**and patience makes the good times sweet!

**ABE: …**and patience makes the good times sweet!

**QUEENIE:** Wonderful!

**ABE:** Now let’s say it again amigos, all together this time!

**ABE & AMIGOS:** Good things are on their way to me, and patience makes the good times sweet!

**QUEENIE:** One last time!

**ABE & AMIGOS:** Good things are on their way to me, and patience makes the good times sweet!

**ABE:** Thanks for that affirmation Queenie, I’m going to say it whenever I feel frustrated and want to remember that feeling stuck doesn’t last forever, and that good things are still ahead! Amigos, you can say this affirmation to yourself in the mirror or with your friends and loved ones! Bye for now, Queenie!

**QUEENIE:** Bye Guncle Abe! Until next time, keep glowing!

_(Abe waves to Queenie as she flitters away, Abe takes off tiara.)_

**ABE:** Thanks amigos for joining me today at recess, where we let our true colors shine! I hope that you’ll remember that good things are on their way to you, and that patience makes the good times so sweet. Things don’t always go our way, but that is _A-ok_. Anytime you need to remember how brilliant and beautiful you are, just put on your crown or tiara and say our new affirmation in the mirror. Now take what you’ve learned here at recess back to your school or to your home! And bring a friend next time! Remember that you are loved, you are beautiful, and you BELONG! See you next time at Recess with Guncle Abe! Bye Amigos!

## EPISODE 2: GRATITUDE 

_(special guest: ELLA)_

**ABE:** When I was a kid, recess was my adventure time—a chance to hang out with friends, dream up amazing stories, and play! I always imagined the playground as a magical world, a place where I learned to shout out loud, be super brave, and most importantly, to celebrate being _me_! Are you ready to dive into a world full of fun, friends, and learning? Let's spark our imaginations and play along in my magical world where _everyone_ belongs. Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe—where every day is a rainbow-filled adventure!

Hello, Abe’s Amigos! Welcome to Recess! I am SO happy you’re here. Wherever you are in the world right now, I hope you are having a MAGICAL day. Today is a GREAT day to feel great and BE great! I’m Guncle Abe—YouTube’s favorite guncle. I love learning about emotions and how to be confident, all while having fun with my amigos, which means “friends” in Spanish! Here at Recess, we’re going to LEARN! We’re going to DANCE! And we’re going to have FUN!

But before we dive in, let’s get grounded by practicing some breathing.

_(Now in the classroom)_

While most of the time we breathe without even thinking about it, we can also use our breathing to relax our bodies and minds! Today we are going to practice breathing while pretending to be rainbows! For this activity, you can sit or stand—it’s totally up to you—just make sure you have enough space to lift your arms up and down. You can close your eyes or keep them open, whatever makes you feel most comfortable. Now, open your hands to face the sky. When you breathe in, lift your hands up to the sky, like a rainbow.

When you breathe out, bring your arms back down to your sides. _(Demonstrate)_

Let’s try it together! Breathe in, lift your arms up to the sky, stretching your arms long and wide. Breathe out, slowly lower your arms back to your sides. Breathe in, lift your arms up and over like a rainbow. Breathe out, bring your arms back down.

Now we are going to make the BIGGEST rainbow yet. Are you ready? Breathe in and reach as _high high high_ as you can and hold your breath at the top of your rainbow—hold it hold it hold it! Breathe out, send all of your air out as far as you can and slowly bring your arms back to your sides. Great work, amigos!

Now that we’ve taken some deep breaths, it’s time for some LEARNING! My friends and I LOVE to learn, and today we’re going to talk about an emotion that starts with the letter G, and that emotion is _GRATITUDE_.

My good friend and teacher extraordinaire, Miss Fanny, is going to come teach us all about it. Miss Fanny LOVES to teach me and my amigos about emotions. _(Miss Fanny appears)_ Hi Miss Fanny, I’m so happy to see you!

**MISS FANNY:** Well hello hello Guncle Abe! What a _glorious_ day to learn about the rainbow of emotions! Are you and your amigos ready to learn about gratitude?

**ABE:** Absolutely, Miss Fanny! I’m _so_ excited to learn! And, guess what? I have a surprise guest with me today!

**MISS FANNY:** A surprise guest? Well isn’t that just the most delightful treat! Guncle Abe, please tell us, who is your special guest? I’m simply fluttery with anticipation!

**ABE:** My amazing, real-life niece Ella is going to join us today! Amigos, say hi to Ella!

_(Ella walks on)_

**ABE:** Hi Ella! I’m so happy you’re here!

**ELLA:** Hi Guncle Abe! Wow, this classroom is magic!

**MISS FANNY:** Hi sweet Ella! I’m so happy to have you join us in my classroom! We were just going to learn about gratitude, would you like to learn too?

**ELLA:** I’d love to, Miss Fanny!

**MISS FANNY:** Get comfortable my dear ones. Today we’re learning all about the word gratitude because it starts with the letter G, the next letter in our alphabet of emotions. Gratitude means appreciation for what you love and the good things in your life.

**ABE:** It’s easy for our brains to get used to all the good things in our lives like a song that you love but you’ve heard a million times. It’s easy for that song to fade in the background and we forget it’s even playing. Gratitude is what helps us remember what we love, like a big warm hug you give with your heart!

**MISS FANNY:** Guncle Abe, I simply love that! Next I want to talk to you about how to practice gratitude and what that means. One of my favorite things to do is to make a list of things that I’m grateful for, and to make a new list every week! Do you and Ella want to share with me some things you’re grateful for? We can make a list right now!

**ABE:** I love that, Miss Fanny! I’ll go first. I’m grateful for being able to travel to new places and see new things—like Australia and New Zealand and watching a beautiful sunset on the water! Ella, what about you?

**ELLA:** I’m grateful for my baby brothers Nico and Jude!

**ABE:** I’m grateful for Nico and Jude, too! You are such a good big sister, Ella. What about you, Miss Fanny?

**MISS FANNY:** I’m grateful for this beautiful classroom where I get to spend time with you all—it simply brings so much joy to my day!

**ABE:** What about you, amigos? What are _you_ grateful for? Take a second to think of something and then turn to the person next to you and tell them about it. We’ll take ten seconds to do this, starting NOW!

_(Musical interlude, Abe & Ella talking - record full stage)_ **MISS FANNY:** Wonderful, just _wonderful_, everyone! I’m so proud of you all. Gratitude keeps our hearts wide open to the world and helps us hold close the things we love. Remember to make a list of all the things you’re grateful for! It’s a lot of fun, too.

**AfBE:** I love that, Miss Fanny. Thanks for teaching us all about gratitude! You are _such_ a good teacher! I can’t wait to see you next time and learn more about our emotions!

**MISS FANNY:** Goodbye for now, Guncle Abe! And bye, Ella! I’ll be seeing youuuuuu! _(Miss Fanny disappears)_

**ABE:** Thanks for joining me Ella! Will you come back later when we go to the Affirmation Station?

**ELLA:** I’d love to!

**ABE:** Yay! Ok I’ll see you really soon. Bye!

**ELLA:** Bye Guncle Abe!

**ABE:** Okay amigos, now it’s time to take a little break from learning to do one of my favorite things in the whole wide world—_DANCING_! Let’s hop on the Jolly Trolly to head to Disco Dance Hall where we’ll meet my friend, Rainbow Ray—the popstar of positive dancing!

_(Abe hops on the Jolly Trolly.)_

**ABE:** HEY Rainbow Ray!! It’s SO good to see you!

**RAINBOW RAY:** Hi Guncle Abe! It’s so good to see you too!

**ABE:** Rainbow Ray, we just learned about gratitude and you know what? I am so grateful for you. Dancing makes me feel happy and I love having a friend who loves it as much as I do. And that’s you!

**RAINBOW RAY:** Aw, thanks Guncle Abe! I’m grateful for you, too. Now let’s get dancing!

**ABE:** Alright amigos, I’m going to teach you a dance for our dance party! But before we learn the dance moves, I want to tell you something very important, so listen closely. Disco Dance Hall is your space to express yourself and move exactly the way that feels good to you. If it feels better to wiggle, move your hands, or close your eyes and just listen to the music, this is where we accept ALL of who we are, whatever that looks like! This space is all about moving your body in a way that feels unique to YOU. Now, I’m going to show you the moves if you want to dance, so follow my instructions!

_(Abe shows kids dance number choreographed by Ena)_

**ABE:** Now it’s OUR turn to dance! Are you ready?! Let’s do this! 3, 2, 1! _DANCE TIME!_

_(Dance party!)_

**ABE:** Amigos, your dance moves are looking great out there! That was so much fun! Thanks for dancing with us, Rainbow Ray!

**RAINBOW RAY:** I’m so grateful you came by to dance with me! I love dancing with my friends!

**ABE:** We’ll come back soon for another dance party—bye for now, Ray!

**RAINBOW RAY**: Peace out, Guncle Abe! Stay groovy! _(Rainbow Ray leaves)_

**ABE:** Wow, my body feels _so_ good after dancing! I’m having so much fun with you all. Alright amigos, you feeling good? We have one more stop left today, so let’s hop back on the Jolly Trolly and head to the Affirmation Station! _(Ella twirls in)_

**ELLA:** Did someone say Jolly Trolly? I love the Jolly Trolly!

**ABE:** Come on Ella, let’s go!

_(Abe & Ella ride to Affirmation Station)_

**ABE:** Ella, my friend Queenie lives here at the Affirmation Station, isn’t it magical? I’m so grateful for how Queenie teaches me how to love myself for exactly who I am. _(Queenie appears)_ Hi Queenie!

**QUEENIE:** Oh hello, sweet Guncle Abe! I’m absolutely _delighted_ that you’re here!

**ABE:** Queenie, I have a surprise for you!

**QUEENIE:** Guncle Abe, you know I love surprises! Who is this amiga?

**ABE:** My amazing niece Ella is here today to help us out with the affirmation!

**ELLA:** Hi Queenie! I love your crown! So good to meet you!

**QUEENIE:** Hi sweet Ella! It’s so lovely meeting you, too! Did you happen to bring a tiara with you?

**ELLA:** I did! I LOVE tiaras!

**QUEENIE:** Oh I’d love to see!

**ABE:** Amigos, let’s _all_ put on our crowns and tiaras! _(Abe & Ella put on his tiara.)_

**QUEENIE:**  We truly do love to see it. Wearing our crowns and tiaras reminds us of how special we are. You all are _glowing_!

**ABE:** Queenie, today we learned about gratitude. Do you have an affirmation you can teach us to go with that emotion?

**QUEENIE:** Oh I have just the thing! Here’s the affirmation, are you ready, Ella?

**ELLA:** YES! So ready, Queenie!

**QUEENIE:** Alright, repeat after me: I remember all the good things, like a song I always sing!

**ABE:** I remember all the good things, like a song I always sing!

**QUEENIE:** Yes yes!

**ABE:** Now let’s say it again, together this time!

**ABE, AMIGOS, ELLA:** I remember all the good things, like a song I always sing!

**ABE:** Thanks for that affirmation Queenie, I’m going to say it to help me remember what I’m grateful for every day. Amigos, you can say this affirmation to yourself in the mirror or with your friends and loved ones! And Ella, you can teach it to your younger brothers, Nico & Jude!

**ELLA:** _(giggles)_ I’ll try, Guncle Abe!

**ABE:** Thanks for coming to visit me at Recess, Ella! Come back soon, ok?

**ELLA:** Bye, Guncle Abe! I love you!

**ABE:** _(waving)_ I love you too, Ella, bye for now!

**QUEENIE:** Bye Ella! And bye Guncle Abe! Keep glowing!

**ABE:** Bye for now, Queenie!

_(Abe waves to Queenie as she flitters away, Abe takes off tiara.)_

**ABE:** Thanks amigos for joining me today at recess, where we let our true colors shine! I hope you’ll remember that there is always sparkly beauty to see! Anytime you need to remember how brilliant and beautiful you are, just put your crown or tiara on and say our new affirmation in the mirror. Now take what you’ve learned here at recess back to your school or to your home! And bring a friend next time! Remember that you are loved, you are beautiful, and you BELONG! See you next time at Recess with Guncle Abe! Bye Amigos!

## EPISODE 3: HAPPINESS 

_(special guest: ELLA)_

**ABE:** When I was a kid, recess was my adventure time—a chance to hang out with friends, dream up amazing stories, and play! I always imagined the playground as a magical world, a place where I learned to shout out loud, be super brave, and most importantly, to celebrate being _me_! Are you ready to dive into a world full of fun, friends, and learning? Let's spark our imaginations and play along in my magical world where _everyone_ belongs. Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe—where every day is a rainbow-filled adventure!

Hello, Abe’s Amigos! Welcome to Recess! I am SO happy you’re here. Wherever you are in the world right now, I hope you are having a MAGICAL day. Today is a GREAT day to feel great and BE great! I’m Guncle Abe—YouTube’s favorite guncle. I love learning about emotions and how to be confident, all while having fun with my amigos, which means “friends” in Spanish! Here at Recess, we’re going to LEARN! We’re going to DANCE! And we’re going to have FUN!

But before we dive in, let’s get grounded into our bodies by practicing some breathing.

_(Now in the classroom)_

Today we’re going to practice blowing bubbles. We’ll start by standing or sitting up nice and tall. Sometimes I keep my eyes open, sometimes I keep them closed—do whatever makes you feel most comfortable. Now, let’s pretend we’re holding up a bubble wand. _(Hold up a pretend wand)_

As I breathe in, I fill up my belly with air. And then as I breathe out, I slowwwwwly blow the bubbles out of the wand so that all the bubbles are gone. _(Demonstrate)_

Try it with me! Breathe in, fill up your belly with air. Breathe out, SLOWLY blow out all of the bubbles. Breathe in, fill up your belly. Breathe out, SLOWLY blow out all of the bubbles. Let’s try it one more time. Breathe in, fill up your belly with air. Breathe out, SLOWLY blow out all of the bubbles. Great job, amigos!

Now that we’ve taken some deep breaths, it’s time for some LEARNING! My friends and I LOVE to learn, and today we’re going to talk about an emotion that starts with the letter H, and that emotion is _HAPPINESS_.

My good friend and teacher extraordinaire, Miss Fanny, is going to come teach us all about it. Miss Fanny LOVES to teach me and my amigos about emotions. _(Miss Fanny appears)_ Hi Miss Fanny, I’m so happy to see you!

**MISS FANNY:** Well hello hello Guncle Abe! What a _beautiful_ day to learn more about the rainbow of emotions! Are you and your amigos ready to learn about happiness?

**ABE:** Absolutely, Miss Fanny! I’m so excited to learn! I have a special guest joining me today!

**MISS FANNY:** A special guest?! Well isn’t that just the most _delightful_ treat! Guncle Abe, who is it? I’m fluttering to know!

**ABE:** Miss Fanny, my sweet and amazing, REAL-LIFE niece Ella is going to be joining us today! Amigos, say hi to Ella!

_(Ella twirls on)_

**ABE:** Hi Ella! I’m so happy you’re here!

**ELLA:** Hi Guncle Abe! I’m so happy to be here again!

**MISS FANNY:** Hi sweet Ella! I’m so happy to have you with us! We were _just_ going to learn about happiness, would you like to learn too?

**ELLA:** I’d love to, Miss Fanny!

**MISS FANNY:** Alright, so get comfortable my dear ones. Today we’re learning all about the word “happiness” because it starts with the letter H, the next letter in our alphabet of emotions. Happiness is a burst of excitement because of something happening in the moment. Remember how last time we talked about gratitude, and how that emotion is something that we both feel _and_ practice? Well, happiness might _seem_ similar, but is different from gratitude. While gratitude is something we practice so we can feel for a long time, happiness is something we feel pretty quickly in a moment, kind of like a butterfly.

**ABE:** Miss Fanny, do you mean that it’s an emotion that lands on us for a little while, then flies away, then finds us again?

**MISS FANNY:** Yes, exactly that, Guncle Abe! It can land on our shoulder for a little while, so the best thing we can do is to notice it and soak it in when it comes. So let’s share some things that make us happy! I’ll go first. I feel happy when I see a rainbow after it rains!

**ABE:** That’s a good one, Miss Fanny! Singing, riding on a boat, and eating ice cream on a summer day all make me happy! Ella, what about you? What’s something that makes _you_ happy?

**ELLA:** Dressing up in princess dresses and dancing in my living room makes me happy!

**ABE:** Great one, Ella! I _know_ that makes you happy! What about you, amigos? When is a time when _you_ felt happiness? Take a second to think of something and then turn to the person next to you and tell them about it. We’ll take about ten seconds to do this, starting NOW!

_(Abe whispers his response to Miss Fanny while a musical interlude plays)_ **MISS FANNY:** Wonderful, just _wonderful_, everyone! I’m so proud of you all.

**ABE:** Thanks for teaching us about happiness Miss Fanny! You are _such_ a good teacher! I can’t wait to see you next time and learn more about our emotions!

**MISS FANNY:** Goodbye for now, Guncle Abe! And goodbye, Ella! I’m so happy that you joined us today! I’ll be seeing youuuuuu! _(Miss Fanny disappears)_

**ABE:** Ella, will you come back later when we visit the Affirmation Station? I would love to try on tiaras with you.

**ELLA:** That sounds so fun, Guncle Abe! I’ll be back! Bye! _(cutie Ella exit)_

**ABE:** Bye Ella! _(Ella disappears)_ Okay amigos, now it’s time to take a little break from learning to do one of my favorite things in the whole wide world—_DANCING_! Let’s hop on the Jolly Trolly to head to Disco Dance Hall where we’ll meet my friend, Rainbow Ray—the popstar of positive dancing!

_(Abe hops on the Jolly Trolly)_

**ABE:** HEY Rainbow Ray!! I’m so happy to see you!

**RAINBOW RAY:** Hi Guncle Abe! I’m happy to see you too! Dance parties with you and the amigos are the highlight of my whole day! Let’s start the fun!

**ABE:** Alright amigos, I’m going to teach you a dance for our dance party! But before we learn the dance moves, I want to tell you something very important, so listen closely. Disco Dance Hall is your space to express yourself and move exactly the way that feels good to you. If it feels better to wiggle, move your hands, or close your eyes and just listen to the music, this is where we accept ALL of who we are, whatever that looks like! This space is all about moving your body in a way that feels unique to YOU. Now, I’m going to show you the moves if you want to dance, so follow my instructions!

_(Abe shows kids dance number choreographed by Ena)_

**ABE:** Now it’s OUR turn to dance! Are you ready?! Let’s do this! 3, 2, 1! _DANCE TIME!_

_(Abe & Rainbow Ray dance party!)_

**ABE:** Wow, that was so fun! Amigos, your dance moves are looking _great_ out there! _(Mischievously points at camera)_ Have you been practicing? I can tell! Thanks for dancing with us, Rainbow Ray! After learning what happiness means today, I can honestly say that dancing makes me deeply happy. It feels _so good_ moving through all the emotions with you!

**RAINBOW RAY:** Dancing makes me feel really happy, too! Thanks for dancing with me!

**ABE:** We’ll be back soon for another dance party—bye for now, Rainbow Ray!

**RAINBOW RAY**: I’ll be counting down the minutes! See you again soon, amigos! And peace out, Guncle Abe! Stay groovy! _(Rainbow Ray leaves)_

**ABE:** Alright amigos, you know what time it is! We have one more stop left today, so let’s hop back on the Jolly Trolly and head to the Affirmation Station! Ella, are you ready? It’s Jolly Trolly time! _(Ella twirls in)_

**ELLA:** You know I love a train ride!

_(Abe & Ella ride to Affirmation Station)_

**ABE:** Ella, my friend Queenie lives here at the Affirmation Station, and she teaches me how to love myself for exactly who I am. _(Queenie appears)_ Hi Queenie!

**QUEENIE:** Oh hello, sweet Guncle Abe! I’m thrilled that you’re here! It’s so good to see you.

**ABE:** Queenie, I want to introduce you to my niece, Ella! She’s going to help us out with today’s affirmation. _(Ella appears, waving)_

**ELLA:** Hi Guncle Abe! Hi Queenie! I can’t wait to hear the affirmation!

**ABE:** Queenie, today we learned about happiness—can you teach us an affirmation to go with that emotion?

**QUEENIE:** Guncle Abe and Ella, I have just the thing! But before I share my affirmation with you, I want us all to find our crowns and tiaras and put them on, to remind us of how special we are.

_(Abe and Ella put on their tiaras.)_

**ELLA:** What do you think of mine, Queenie?

**QUEENIE:** Oh it is simply _DIVINE_! You _all_ are glowing! Now, here’s the affirmation, are you ready? Repeat after me: I soak in happiness when it comes, a beautiful butterfly to enjoy!

**ABE:** I soak in happiness when it comes, a beautiful butterfly to enjoy!

**QUEENIE:** So wonderful!

**ABE:** Now let’s say it again amigos, together this time!

**ABE & AMIGOS:** I soak in happiness when it comes, a beautiful butterfly to enjoy!

**ABE:** Thanks for that affirmation Queenie, I’m going to say it to help me remember to soak in happiness when it comes. Amigos, you can say this affirmation to yourself in the mirror or with your friends and loved ones! Bye for now, Queenie! Thanks for helping us, Ella!

**QUEENIE:** Bye Guncle Abe! Bye Ella! Bye amigos! Until next time, keep glowing!

**ELLA:** Bye everybody! Love you, Guncle Abe!

**ABE:** I love you, too, Ella! Bye!

_(Abe waves to Queenie and Ella as they disappear. Abe takes off tiara.)_

**ABE:** Thanks amigos for joining me today at recess, where we let our true colors shine! I hope you’ll remember to notice the moments that make you happy, and even say it out loud when you feel it! And anytime you need to remember how brilliant and beautiful you are, just put on your crown or tiara and say our new affirmation in the mirror. Now take what you’ve learned here at recess back to your school or to your home! And bring a friend next time! Remember that you are loved, you are beautiful, and you BELONG! See you next time at Recess with Guncle Abe! Bye Amigos!

## EPISODE 4: IMPATIENCE 

**ABE:** When I was a kid, recess was my adventure time—a chance to hang out with friends, dream up amazing stories, and play! I always imagined the playground as a magical world, a place where I learned to shout out loud, be super brave, and most importantly, to celebrate being _me_! Are you ready to dive into a world full of fun, friends, and learning? Let's spark our imaginations and play along in my magical world where _everyone_ belongs. Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe—where every day is a rainbow-filled adventure!

Hello, Abe’s Amigos! Welcome to Recess! I am SO happy you’re here. Wherever you are in the world right now, I hope you are having a MAGICAL day. Today is a GREAT day to feel great and BE great! I’m Guncle Abe—YouTube’s favorite guncle. I love learning about emotions and how to be confident, all while having fun with my amigos, which means “friends” in Spanish! Here at Recess, we’re going to LEARN! We’re going to DANCE! And we’re going to have FUN!

But before we dive in, let’s get grounded in our bodies by practicing some breathing.

_(Now in the classroom)_

Today I’m going to show you how to breathe like a lion, and then you’ll have the chance to try it with me! You can stand or sit for this activity, it’s totally up to you, but make sure you have enough space to lift your arms up and down. Close your eyes or keep them open, whatever makes you feel comfortable. As we breathe in, we’ll lift our hands up towards the sky.

As we breathe out, we’ll bring our hands down behind our ears with our palms facing out to make our lion’s mane. Next, open your mouth wide and roar like a lion as you breathe out*.* _(Demonstrate)_

Now let’s try it together! You ready, amigos? Breathe in, lift your hands up to the sky, breathe out, bring your hands behind your ears to make your lion’s mane, open your mouth wide, and roar! _(Demonstrate)_

Let’s try it again! Breathe in, lift your hands up to the sky, breathe out, bring your hands to your ears to make your lion’s mane, open your mouth wide and _roar_!

One more time! Breathe in, lift your hands to the sky, breathe out, bring your hands to your ears, and roar! Great job, amigos! You can do this breathing exercise anytime you’re feeling a lot of feelings! Breathing helps me to slow down and make all the loud energy a little more calm.

Now that we’ve taken some deep breaths, it’s time for some LEARNING! My friends and I LOVE to learn, and today we’re going to talk about an emotion that starts with the letter I, and that emotion is _IMPATIENCE_.

My good friend and teacher extraordinaire, Miss Fanny, is going to come teach us all about it. Miss Fanny LOVES to teach me and my amigos about emotions. _(Miss Fanny appears)_ Hi Miss Fanny, I’m so happy to see you!

**MISS FANNY:** Well hello hello Guncle Abe! I’m so happy to see you too! What an _incredible_ day to learn more about the rainbow of emotions! Are you and your amigos ready to learn about impatience?

**ABE:** Absolutely, Miss Fanny! I’m so excited to learn!

**MISS FANNY:** Alright, get comfortable my dear ones. Today we’re learning all about the word “impatience” because it starts with the letter I, the next letter in the alphabet of emotions. Impatience is that feeling of being annoyed or uncomfortable when something is taking too long or when you’re ready for something to change. You know how your skin can get itchy sometimes after walking through tall grass? Well, impatience is kind of like feeling itchy on the inside—waiting for a long time can make you itchy!

**ABE:** Miss Fanny, let’s give the amigos some examples of what impatience can look like!

**MISS FANNY:** Marvelous idea, Guncle Abe! Let’s do it. And I know _you_ have some examples too!

**ABE:** I sure do, Miss Fanny! Amigos, have you ever had to wait in a _really_ _long_ _line_ for your favorite ride at the park? That feeling of not wanting to wait is impatience!

**MISS FANNY:** And you might also feel impatient when your parents say you have to wait for dessert until _everyone_ at the table is done eating dinner first.

**ABE:** Or when you have a playdate with a friend later but wish it was _right now_!

**MISS FANNY:** We all have to wait for things sometimes, so it’s completely normal to feel impatient. While there’s absolutely nothing wrong with feeling impatient, we _can_ learn how to be more calm and patient even while we’re itching for things to hurry up or change. I have a feeling that Queenie will be able to help you and your amigos with that a little later today!

**ABE:** Miss Fanny, I’m glad you said that it’s normal to feel impatient sometimes. It can be so hard to wait for things that we really want! It makes me feel better knowing that being patient while I wait is something I can practice.

**MISS FANNY:** Indeed it is, Guncle Abe! Even us adults need practicing! _Everyone_ feels impatient sometimes!

**ABE:** What about you, amigos? When’s a time when _you_ felt impatient? Think of a moment and then tell the person next to you about it. We’ll take around ten seconds to do this, starting NOW.

_(Abe whispers his response to Miss Fanny while a musical interlude plays)_ **MISS FANNY:** Wonderful, just _wonderful_, everyone! I’m so proud of you all.

**ABE:** Thanks for teaching us about impatience Miss Fanny! You are _such_ a good teacher! I can’t wait to see you next time and learn more about emotions!

**MISS FANNY:** Goodbye for now, Guncle Abe! And goodbye, amigos! I’ll be seeing youuuuuu! _(Miss Fanny disappears)_

**ABE:** Okay amigos, now it’s time to take a little break from learning to do one of my favorite things in the whole wide world—_DANCING_! Let’s hop on the Jolly Trolly to head to Disco Dance Hall where we’ll meet my friend, Rainbow Ray—the popstar of positive dancing!

_(Abe hops on the Jolly Trolly)_

**ABE:** Hey Rainbow Ray! I’m so happy to see you and I’m _so_ ready to dance.

**RAINBOW RAY:** Hi hi hi Guncle Abe! I’m so happy to see you too! I’ve been waiting all day for this dance party!

**ABE:** Rainbow Ray, the amigos and I just learned how impatience can sometimes feel like an itch inside, when you can’t wait for what’s coming next. I was thinking on the Jolly Trolly that maybe dancing is a good thing to do when we feel impatient! That maybe dancing can help scratch that itch and give us something to do while we wait?

**RAINBOW RAY:** Guncle Abe, I _personally_ think that dancing is the answer to _everything_—it helps me move through all the emotions, _especially_ impatience. If you think about it, if impatience happens when we’re feeling antsy about waiting, dancing gives you something to do with all that energy!

**ABE:** I love that, Rainbow Ray! I’m so ready to dance!

**ABE:** Alright amigos, I’m going to teach you a dance for our dance party. But before we learn the dance moves, I want to tell you something very important, so listen closely. Disco Dance Hall is your space to express yourself and move exactly the way that feels good to you. If it feels better to wiggle, move your hands, or close your eyes and just listen to the music, this is where we accept ALL of who we are, whatever that looks like! This space is all about moving your body in a way that feels unique to YOU. Now, I’m going to show you the moves if you want to dance, so follow my instructions!

_(Abe shows kids dance number)_

**ABE:** Now it’s OUR turn to dance! Are you ready?! Let’s do this! 3, 2, 1! _DANCE TIME!_

_(Abe & Rainbow Ray dance party!)_

**ABE:** Wow, that was so fun! Amigos, your dance moves are looking _great_ out there! Thanks for dancing with me! And thanks for dancing with _us_, Rainbow Ray! Next time I feel impatient, I know exactly what to do. Dancing moves all the emotions through!

**RAINBOW RAY:** You know I’ll take _any_ reason to dance—so I love that, Guncle Abe! I had the best time dancing with you and the amigos, too!

**ABE:** We’ll be back soon for another dance party—bye for now, Rainbow Ray!

**RAINBOW RAY**: Peace out, Guncle Abe! Bye amigos! Stay groovy! _(Rainbow Ray leaves)_

**ABE:** Alright amigos, we have one more stop left today, so let’s hop back on the Jolly Trolly and head to the Affirmation Station!

_(Abe rides Jolly Trolly to Affirmation Station)_

**ABE:** My friend Queenie lives here at the Affirmation Station. She teaches me how to love myself for _exactly_ who I am. _(Queenie appears)_ Hi Queenie!

**QUEENIE:** Hi Guncle Abe! It’s absolutely magical to see you. And hello to you, too, amigos!

**ABE:** Queenie, today we learned about impatience—can you teach us an affirmation to go with that emotion?

**QUEENIE:** Oh Guncle Abe, What an important emotion to learn about! I know that whenever I feel impatient, it helps for me to think about how in nature, the flowers wait _all_ _winter_ _long_ before blooming in the spring. Nature is so very patient and a wonderful teacher. Ok, back to the affirmation—but before I share it, I want us all to find our crowns and tiaras and put them on, to remind us of how special we are.

_(Abe tries on tiaras.)_

**ABE:** What do you think of mine, Queenie?

**QUEENIE:** Oh it is simply _DIVINE_! You _all_ are glowing so bright! Now, here’s the affirmation, are you ready? Repeat after me: patience makes me powerful!

**ABE:** Patience makes me powerful!

**QUEENIE:** Wonderful!

**ABE:** Let’s say it again amigos, together this time!

**ABE & AMIGOS:** Patience makes me powerful!

**ABE:** Thanks for that affirmation Queenie! I’m going to say it to help me remember that feeling impatient is _totally ok_, and that learning to wait—like nature does—makes me even more powerful. Amigos, you can say this affirmation to yourself in the mirror or with your friends and loved ones! Bye for now, Queenie!

**QUEENIE:** Bye Guncle Abe! Bye amigos! Until next time, _keep glowing_!

_(Abe waves to Queenie. Abe takes off tiara.)_

**ABE:** Thanks amigos for joining me today at recess, where we let our true colors shine! I hope you’ll remember that patience makes you powerful. And anytime you need to remember how brilliant and beautiful you are, just put on your crown or tiara and say our new affirmation in the mirror. Now take what you’ve learned here at recess back to your school or to your home! And bring a friend next time! Remember that you are loved, you are beautiful, and you BELONG! See you next time at Recess with Guncle Abe! Bye Amigos!

## EPISODE 5: JEALOUSY

**ABE:** When I was a kid, recess was my adventure time—a chance to hang out with friends, dream up amazing stories, and play! I always imagined the playground as a magical world, a place where I learned to shout out loud, be super brave, and most importantly, to celebrate being _me_! Are you ready to dive into a world full of fun, friends, and learning? Let's spark our imaginations and play along in my magical world where _everyone_ belongs. Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe—where every day is a rainbow-filled adventure!

Hello, Abe’s Amigos! Welcome to Recess! I am SO happy you’re here. Wherever you are in the world right now, I hope you are having a MAGICAL day. Today is a GREAT day to feel great and BE great! I’m Guncle Abe—YouTube’s favorite guncle. I love learning about emotions and how to be confident, all while having fun with my amigos, which means “friends” in Spanish! Here at Recess, we’re going to LEARN! We’re going to DANCE! And we’re going to have FUN!

But before we dive in, let’s get grounded into our bodies by practicing some breathing.

_(Now in the classroom)_

Today we’re going to practice blowing bubbles. We’ll start by standing or sitting up nice and tall. Sometimes I keep my eyes open, sometimes I keep them closed—do whatever makes you feel most comfortable. Now, let’s pretend we’re holding up a bubble wand. _(Hold up a pretend wand)_

As I breathe in, I fill up my belly with air. And then as I breathe out, I slowwwwwly blow the bubbles out of the wand so that all the bubbles are gone. _(Demonstrate)_

Try it with me! Breathe in, fill up your belly with air. Breathe out, SLOWLY blow out all of the bubbles. Breathe in, fill up your belly. Breathe out, SLOWLY blow out all of the bubbles. Let’s try it one more time. Breathe in, fill up your belly with air. Breathe out, SLOWLY blow out all of the bubbles. Great job, amigos!

Now that we’ve taken some deep breaths, it’s time for some LEARNING! My friends and I LOVE to learn, and today we’re going to talk about an emotion that starts with the letter J, and that emotion is _JEALOUSY_.

My good friend and teacher extraordinaire, Miss Fanny, is going to come teach us all about it. Miss Fanny LOVES to teach me and my amigos about emotions. _(Miss Fanny appears)_ Hi Miss Fanny, I’m so happy to see you!

**MISS FANNY:** Well hello hello Guncle Abe! What a _joyous_ day to learn more about the rainbow of emotions! Are you and your amigos ready to learn about jealousy?

**ABE:** Absolutely, Miss Fanny! I’m so excited to learn!

**MISS FANNY:** Alright, get comfortable my dear ones. Today we’re learning all about the word “jealousy” because it starts with the letter J, the next letter in our alphabet of emotions. Jealousy is the feeling of being afraid of losing a friend or a friend’s attention to somebody else. Feeling jealous means being afraid of losing what you already have.

**ABE:** Miss Fanny, let’s give the amigos some examples of what feeling jealous might look like!

**MISS FANNY:** I love that idea, Guncle Abe! I’ll go first. You might feel jealous when two of your friends have a playdate without you and you wish you were invited, too.

**ABE:** Or you might feel jealous when your parents bring a new baby home from the hospital and are busy taking care of them. While you’re excited about your new brother or sister, you also want your parents to spend more time with you, like they did before. So Miss Fanny, is jealousy kind of like being afraid of being left out?

**MISS FANNY:** That’s a great way to think of it, Guncle Abe! Being afraid of losing time, attention, and playdates to other people is exactly what jealousy can be.

**ABE:** What about _you_, amigos? Can you think of a time when _you_ felt jealous? Think of a moment and then share with a person sitting next to you, or find a parent and tell them about it. We’ll take about ten seconds to do this, starting NOW!

_(Abe whispers his response to Miss Fanny while a musical interlude plays)_ **MISS FANNY:** Wonderful, just _wonderful_, everyone! I’m so proud of you all for being brave enough to remember a time you felt jealous. It’s not the easiest emotion to feel, so being able to put words to that cloudy feeling is such a huge step!

**ABE:** Thank you for teaching us about jealousy Miss Fanny! You are _such_ a good teacher! I can’t wait to see you next time and learn more about our emotions!

**MISS FANNY:** Goodbye for now, Guncle Abe! And goodbye, amigos! I’ll be seeing youuuuuu!

**ABE:** Bye Miss Fanny! _(Miss Fanny disappears)_ Okay amigos, now it’s time to take a little break from learning to do one of my favorite things in the whole wide world—_DANCING_! Let’s hop on the Jolly Trolly to head to Disco Dance Hall where we’ll meet my friend, Rainbow Ray—the popstar of positive dancing!

_(Abe hops on the Jolly Trolly)_

**ABE:** HEY Rainbow Ray!! I’m so happy to see you!

**RAINBOW RAY:** Hi Guncle Abe! I’m happy to see you too! Dance parties with you and the amigos are my favorite part of every day! I hope you’re ready to groove!

**ABE:** I am SO READY, Rainbow Ray! Are _you_ ready, amigos?! Ok GREAT, that’s what I thought. Alright amigos, I’m going to teach you a dance for our dance party! But before we learn the dance moves, I want to tell you something very important, so listen closely. Disco Dance Hall is your space to express yourself and move exactly the way that feels good to you. If it feels better to wiggle, move your hands, or close your eyes and just listen to the music, this is where we accept ALL of who we are, whatever that looks like! This space is all about moving your body in a way that feels unique to YOU. Now, I’m going to show you the moves if you want to dance, so follow my instructions!

_(Abe shows kids dance number choreographed by Ena)_

**ABE:** Now it’s OUR turn to dance! Are you ready?! Let’s do this! 3, 2, 1! _DANCE TIME!_

_(Abe & Rainbow Ray dance party!)_

**ABE:** Wow, that was _so fun_! Amigos, your dance moves are looking _great_ out there! _(Mischievously points at camera)_ Have you been practicing? I can tell! Thanks for dancing with us, Rainbow Ray! Dancing through my emotions with you always makes me feel better.

**RAINBOW RAY:** Dancing makes me feel better, too, Guncle Abe! Thanks for dancing with me, amigos!

**ABE:** We’ll be back soon, don’t you worry—bye for now, Rainbow Ray!

**RAINBOW RAY**: Peace out, Guncle Abe! Bye amigos! Until next time, stay groovy! _(Rainbow Ray leaves)_

**ABE:** Amigos, I’m having so much fun with you, I don’t want this day to end! Thankfully we still have one more stop to make today, so let’s hop back on the Jolly Trolly and head to the Affirmation Station!

_(Abe rides to Affirmation Station)_

**ABE:** My friend Queenie lives here at the Affirmation Station. She teaches me how to love myself for _exactly_ who I am. _(Queenie appears)_ Hi Queenie!

**QUEENIE:** Oh hello, sweet Guncle Abe! I’m thrilled that you’re here! It’s so good to see you.

**ABE:** Queenie, today we learned about jealousy—can you teach us an affirmation to go with that emotion?

**QUEENIE:** Guncle Abe, I have just the thing! But before I share my affirmation with you, I want us all to find our crowns and tiaras and put them on, to remind us of how special we are.

_(Abe tries on tiaras.)_

**ABE:** What do you think of mine, Queenie?

**QUEENIE:** You look simply _DIVINE_! You _all_ are glowing! Now, here’s the affirmation, are you ready? We’ll break it down into a few parts. Here’s the first one, repeat after me: I am loved and I am special—no one can replace me!

**ABE:** I am loved and I am special—no one can replace me!

**QUEENIE:** And here’s the last part: There is room for everyone!

**ABE:** There is room for everyone!

**QUEENIE:** Now let’s say the whole thing, are you ready? I am loved and I am special—no one can replace me! There is room for everyone!

**ABE:** I am loved and I am special—no one can replace me! There is room for everyone!

**QUEENIE:** Amazing job! Now say it again amigos, all together this time!

**ABE & AMIGOS:** I am loved and I am special—no one can replace me! There is room for everyone!

**ABE:** Thanks for that affirmation Queenie, I’m going to say it to help me remember that I’m special and important even when I might feel jealous sometimes. Amigos, you can say this affirmation to yourself in the mirror or with your friends and loved ones!

**QUEENIE:** I love that, Guncle Abe! Yes, the affirmation is here for you _whenever_ you need it. Thanks for stopping by to see me! Bye Guncle Abe! Bye amigos! Until next time, keep glowing!

**ABE:** Bye Queenie! _(Waves to Queenie as she disappears)_

**ABE:** Thanks amigos for joining me today at recess, where we let our true colors shine! I hope you’ll remember that you’re special and irreplaceable even if you don’t always feel that way. Everyone feels jealous sometimes, and it’s ok to not be invited to every party. You are loved and special no matter what, amigos! Anytime you need to remember how brilliant and beautiful you are, just put on your crown or tiara and say our new affirmation in the mirror. Now take what you’ve learned here at recess back to your school or to your home! And bring a friend next time! Remember that you are loved, you are beautiful, and you BELONG! See you next time at Recess with Guncle Abe! Bye Amigos!

## EPISODE 6: LOVE 

_(special guest: Ella for Rainbow Breathing & Disco Dance Hall)_

**ABE:** When I was a kid, recess was my adventure time—a chance to hang out with friends, dream up amazing stories, and play! I always imagined the playground as a magical world, a place where I learned to shout out loud, be super brave, and most importantly, to celebrate being _me_! Are you ready to dive into a world full of fun, friends, and learning? Let's spark our imaginations and play along in my magical world where _everyone_ belongs. Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe—where every day is a rainbow-filled adventure!

Hello, Abe’s Amigos! Welcome to Recess! I am SO happy you’re here. Wherever you are in the world right now, I hope you are having a MAGICAL day. Today is a GREAT day to feel great and BE great! I’m Guncle Abe—YouTube’s favorite guncle. I love learning about emotions and how to be confident, all while having fun with my amigos, which means “friends” in Spanish! Here at Recess, we’re going to LEARN! We’re going to DANCE! And we’re going to have FUN!

But before we dive in, let’s get grounded into our bodies by practicing some breathing.

_(Now in the classroom)_

Today I have a special surprise, amigos! To help us out with breathing, my niece Ella is going to join us! _(Ella appears)_

**ELLA:** Hi Guncle Abe! Hi amigos! _(Abe & Ella hug)_

**ABE:** Hi Ella, I’m so happy you’re here! Thanks for joining me! Are you ready for some rainbow breathing?

**ELLA:** Yes! Let’s do it!

**ABE:** Ok here we go, you can follow along with me! Alright amigos, for this activity, you can sit or stand—it’s totally up to you—just make sure you have enough space to lift your arms up and down. You can close your eyes or keep them open, whatever makes you feel most comfortable.

Now, open your hands to face the sky. When you breathe in, lift your hands up to the sky, like a rainbow.

When you breathe out, bring your arms back down to your sides. _(Demonstrate)_

Let’s try it together! Breathe in, lift your arms up to the sky, stretching your arms long and wide. Breathe out, slowly lower your arms back to your sides. Breathe in, lift your arms up and over like a rainbow. Breathe out, bring your arms back down.

Now we are going to make the BIGGEST rainbow yet. Are you ready? Breathe in and reach as _high high high_ as you can and hold your breath at the top of your rainbow—hold it hold it hold it! Breathe out, send all of your air out as far as you can and slowly bring your arms back to your sides.

Great job, Ella! Thanks for breathing with me!

**ELLA:** I loved it!

**ABE:** Ella, would you like to come back later today when we go to Disco Dance Hall? I’d love to teach you a new dance if that sounds fun to you!

**ELLA:** That sounds _so fun_, Guncle Abe! I’ll be back! See you later!

**ABE:** Ok perfect! Bye Ella!

**ELLA:** Bye! _(Ella waves and twirls off)_

**ABE:** Alright amigos, now that we’ve taken some deep breaths, it’s time for some LEARNING! My friends and I LOVE to learn, and today we’re going to talk about an emotion that starts with the letter L, and that emotion is _LOVE_.

My good friend and teacher extraordinaire, Miss Fanny, is going to come teach us all about it. Miss Fanny LOVES to teach me and my amigos about emotions. _(Miss Fanny appears)_ Hi Miss Fanny, I’m so happy to see you!

**MISS FANNY:** Well hello hello Guncle Abe! What a _gorgeous_ day to learn more about the rainbow of emotions! Are you and your amigos ready to learn about love?

**ABE:** Absolutely, Miss Fanny! I’m so excited to learn!

**MISS FANNY:** Alright, get comfortable my dear ones. Today we’re learning all about “love” because it starts with the letter L, the next letter in our alphabet of emotions. Love is the special connection we feel with others and ourselves, something we can water and grow like a garden. Learning to love ourselves for _exactly_ who we are—whenever we mess up or whenever we do something we’re really proud of—helps us love others better.

**ABE:** What a beautiful thing to feel! I _love_ love. _(puts hands over his heart, whimsically)_

**MISS FANNY:** _(giggles)_ Me too, Guncle Abe! And it’s important to remember that love isn’t _just_ romantic love like we see in the movies. There are all different _kinds_ of love! Love is also the feeling you feel when you’re snuggled up close to your pet. Or when your mom or dad gives you a hug after you’ve had a hard day at school. Love is a feeling of safety knowing that the people you care about are there for you no matter what.

**ABE:** So like how different flowers can grow in the same garden, there’s so many different kinds of love! And love is like the water that helps everything grow.

**MISS FANNY:** Exactly, Guncle Abe! And the more love that we feel in ourselves, the more we can give to others. So loving ourselves is the _perfect_ place to start.

**ABE:** Miss Fanny, what’s something that you love about yourself?

**MISS FANNY:** Ooh, what a delightful question! Let me think for a minute. I love how I can be both silly and serious, I love to learn and I love to have fun while doing it! What about you, Guncle Abe? What’s something you love about yourself?

**ABE:** Hmmmm. Let me think. Oh, I know! I love that I love having adventures. Being open to exploring new places and meeting new friends is something that I love about myself!

**MISS FANNY:** That is quite a loveable quality, I must say!

**ABE:** What about _you_, amigos? What’s something that you love about _yourself_? It can be anything! Take a second to think and then turn to the person next to you and tell them about it. We’ll take about ten seconds to do this, starting NOW!

_(Abe whispers his response to Miss Fanny while a musical interlude plays)_ **MISS FANNY:** Wonderful, just _wonderful_, everyone! I’m so proud of you all for taking a moment to love yourself.

**ABE:** Thanks for teaching us about love Miss Fanny! You are _such_ a good teacher! I can’t wait to see you next time and learn more about our emotions!

**MISS FANNY:** Goodbye for now, Guncle Abe! I truly do love it when you all come visit me. I’ll be seeing youuuuuu!

**ABE:** Bye Miss Fanny! _(Miss Fanny disappears)_ Okay amigos, now it’s time to take a little break from learning to do one of the things I love most in the whole wide world—_DANCING_! Let’s hop on the Jolly Trolly to head to Disco Dance Hall where we’ll meet my friend, Rainbow Ray—the popstar of positive dancing! All aboard the Jolly Trolly! Ella, are you ready to go?

_(Ella appears, twirling)_

**ELLA:** I was born ready, Guncle Abe! Let’s do this!

_(Abe & Ella ride the Jolly Trolly)_

**ABE:** HEY Rainbow Ray!! I’m so happy to see you! Meet my niece, Ella! She’s going to be dancing with us today!

**RAINBOW RAY:** Hi Guncle Abe! And I’m so happy to meet you, Ella! Do you love to dance as much as your Guncle?

**ELLA:** You better believe it, Ray! I’ve got MOVES! (_strikes a pose)_

**ABE:** Alright amigos, I’m going to teach you a dance for our dance party! But before we learn the dance moves, I want to tell you something very important, so listen closely. Disco Dance Hall is your space to express yourself and move exactly the way that feels good to you. If it feels better to wiggle, move your hands, or close your eyes and just listen to the music, this is where we accept ALL of who we are, whatever that looks like! This space is all about moving your body in a way that feels unique to YOU.

**ELLA:**  Guncle Abe, I already know this dance! I’m going to take a little snack break then come back for the dance party, ok?

**ABE:** Sounds good Ella! Can’t wait to dance with you! _(Ella disappears)_

_(turns to the camera)_ Okay amigos, are you ready? I’m going to show you the moves if you want to dance, so follow my instructions!

_(Abe shows amigos dance number choreographed by Ena)_

**ABE:** Now it’s OUR turn to dance! Are you ready, Ella? Are you ready, amigos? Let’s do this!

**ABE & ELLA:** 3, 2, 1! _DANCE TIME!_

_(Dance party!)_

**ABE:** Wow, that was so fun! How was that for you, Ella?

**ELLA:** That was the best! I _loved_ dancing with you and the amigos!

**ABE:** Thanks for dancing with us, Rainbow Ray! It feels _so good_ dancing through all the emotions with you!

**RAINBOW RAY:** You know what I always say: a dance party is the best party!

**ABE:** Ella, thanks for joining me—I know that you love to dance at home in your living room, but it was _extra_ special getting to dance with you here at recess. Come back soon, ok?

**ELLA:** Thanks for having me! I’ll definitely come back soon. Bye Guncle Abe, bye amigos! Bye Rainbow Ray!

**RAINBOW RAY**: Bye Ella, see you again soon! Stay groovy! _(Everyone waves, Rainbow Ray & Ella leave)_

**ABE:** Alright amigos, you know what time it is! We have one more stop left today, so let’s hop back on the Jolly Trolly and head to the Affirmation Station!

_(Abe rides to Affirmation Station)_

**ABE:** My friend Queenie lives here at the Affirmation Station. She teaches me how to love myself for _exactly_ who I am. _(Queenie appears)_ Hi Queenie!

**QUEENIE:** Oh hello, Guncle Abe! I’m thrilled that you’re here! It’s so good to see you.

**ABE:** Queenie, today we learned about love—can you teach us an affirmation to go with that emotion?

**QUEENIE:** Guncle Abe, I have _just_ the thing! But before I share my affirmation with you, I want us all to find our crowns and tiaras and put them on, to remind us of how special we are.

_(Abe ties on tiaras.)_

**ABE:** What do you think, Queenie?

**QUEENIE:** Oh you look simply _DIVINE_! You _all_ are glowing! Now, here’s the affirmation, are you ready? We’ll break it down into two parts. Here’s the first part, repeat after me: I’m on my team no matter what.

**ABE:** I’m on my team no matter what!

**QUEENIE:** So wonderful! And here’s the last part, you ready? Flying high or feeling low, loving me is where I go!

**ABE:** Flying high or feeling low, loving me is where I go!

**QUEENIE:** Magnificent!

**ABE:** Now let’s say it again amigos, putting it all together this time!

**ABE & AMIGOS:** I’m on my team no matter what. Flying high or feeling low, loving me is where I go!

**QUEENIE:** One more time!

**ABE & AMIGOS:** I’m on my team no matter what. Flying high or feeling low, loving me is where I go!

**ABE:** Thanks for that affirmation Queenie, I’m going to say it to help me remember to love myself no matter what, because loving myself helps me love others better. Amigos, you can say this affirmation to yourself in the mirror or with your friends and loved ones! Bye for now, Queenie!

**QUEENIE:** Bye Guncle Abe! Bye amigos! Until next time, you know what to do—keep glowing!

_(Abe waves to Queenie, takes off tiara.)_

**ABE:** Thanks amigos for joining me today at recess, where we let our true colors shine! I hope you’ll remember to love yourself no matter what, because belonging begins from within. And anytime you need to remember how brilliant and beautiful you are, just put on your crown or tiara and say our new affirmation in the mirror. Now take what you’ve learned here at recess back to your school or to your home! And bring a friend next time! Remember that you are loved, you are beautiful, and you BELONG! See you next time at Recess with Guncle Abe! Bye Amigos!

## EPISODE 7: NERVOUS

_(special guest = MS. KLARA)_

**ABE:** When I was a kid, recess was my adventure time—a chance to hang out with friends, dream up amazing stories, and play! I always imagined the playground as a magical world, a place where I learned to shout out loud, be super brave, and most importantly, to celebrate being _me_! Are you ready to dive into a world full of fun, friends, and learning? Let's spark our imaginations and play along in my magical world where _everyone_ belongs. Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe—where every day is a rainbow-filled adventure!

Hello, Abe’s Amigos! Welcome to Recess! I am SO happy you’re here. Wherever you are in the world right now, I hope you are having a MAGICAL day. Today is a GREAT day to feel great and BE great! I’m Guncle Abe—YouTube’s favorite guncle. I love learning about emotions and how to be confident, all while having fun with my amigos, which means “friends” in Spanish! Here at Recess, we’re going to LEARN! We’re going to DANCE! And we’re going to have FUN!

But before we dive in, let’s get grounded into our bodies by practicing some breathing.

_(Now in the classroom)_

Sometimes when we have a lot of big feelings, it can be hard to feel calm. When I have big feelings I try birthday candle breathing. Want to try it with me? Let me show you! I start by sitting up straight or standing. I hold up one of my hands and pretend that my fingers are candles on a birthday cake. I breathe in, fill my belly with air. And then as I breathe out, I slooooowly blow out one of my candles then put that finger down. _(Demonstrate)_

Let’s try it! Bring one hand under your face and spread your fingers out wide. Breathe in, fill your belly with air. Breathe out, slowly blow out one of your candles. _(Demonstrate)_

Breathe in, fill your belly with air. Breathe out, slowly blow out one of your candles.

Let’s keep going! Breathe in, fill your belly with air. Breathe out, slowly blow out one of your candles, and then it disappears.

Ok, next one! Breathe in, fill your belly with air. Breathe out, slowly blow out one of your candles. Just one more to go!

Breathe in, fill your belly with air. Breathe out, and blow out your last candle!

Great job, amigos! Remember, you can use birthday candle breathing whenever you are having big feelings and want to feel calm! I feel more relaxed already!

Now that we’ve taken some deep breaths, it’s time for some LEARNING! My friends and I LOVE to learn, and today we’re going to talk about an emotion that starts with the letter N, and that emotion is _NERVOUS_.

My good friend and teacher extraordinaire, Miss Fanny, is going to come teach us all about it. Miss Fanny LOVES to teach me and my amigos about emotions. _(Miss Fanny appears)_ Hi Miss Fanny, I’m so happy to see you!

**MISS FANNY:** Well hello hello Guncle Abe! What a _beautiful_ day to learn more about the rainbow of emotions! Are you and your amigos ready to learn about feeling nervous?

**ABE:** Absolutely, Miss Fanny! I’m so excited to learn!

**MISS FANNY:** Alright, get cozy my dear ones. Today we’re learning all about the word “nervous” because it starts with the letter N, the next letter in our alphabet of emotions. Feeling nervous is a mixture of worry and excitement about something that hasn’t happened yet. Guncle Abe, do you ever feel nervous?

**ABE:** I sure do, Miss Fanny! Sometimes I feel nervous when I’m on an airplane; during takeoff and landing my stomach feels like a whole bunch of fluttery butterflies! And if the plane ride ever gets bumpy, I _definitely_ feel nervous!

**MISS FANNY:** That’s a perfect example, Guncle Abe. Thank you for sharing! We all can feel nervous at times. I know that when _I_ was just a little fan, I’d get nervous before going on stage at a dance recital! The thought of all those eyes watching me would make my spinners start to sweat!

**ABE:** When I feel nervous, it feels like my heart is racing really fast, and my hands can even start to shake a little.

**MISS FANNY:** It can be so very helpful to know what nervousness feels like in your own body, because everyone is different! While nervousness might seem like a bad thing—obviously your heart racing doesn’t feel very good—it’s actually a wonderful messenger, letting us know what we care about!

**ABE:** Like when I get nervous on a plane, that feeling is telling me how much I love to feel cozy and safe and at home with the people I love.

**MISS FANNY:** Exactly! And me feeling nervous on stage was a sign that I really cared about remembering all the dance moves and being a good dancer!

**ABE:** I love that, Miss Fanny! What about _you_, amigos? Have you ever felt nervous? Take a second to think of something and then turn to the person next to you and tell them about it. We’ll take about ten seconds to do this, starting NOW!

_(Abe whispers his response to Miss Fanny while a musical interlude plays)_ **MISS FANNY:** Wonderful, just _wonderful_, everyone! I’m so proud of you all.

**ABE:** Thanks for teaching us about feeling nervous Miss Fanny! You are _such_ a good teacher! I can’t wait to see you next time and learn more about our emotions!

**MISS FANNY:** It is always my deepest joy spending time with you all! Goodbye for now, Guncle Abe! Goodbye amigos! I’ll be seeing youuuuuu! _(Miss Fanny disappears)_

**ABE:** Okay amigos, now it’s time to take a little break from learning to do one of my favorite things in the whole wide world—_DANCING_! Let’s hop on the Jolly Trolly to head to Disco Dance Hall where we’ll meet my friend, Rainbow Ray—the popstar of positive dancing!

_(Abe hops on the Jolly Trolly)_

**ABE:** Hey Rainbow Ray!! I’m so happy to see you!

**RAINBOW RAY:** Hi Guncle Abe! I’m so happy to see you too! I’ve been looking forward to our dance party all day!

**ABE:** Alright amigos, I’m going to teach you a dance for our dance party! But before we learn the dance moves, I want to tell you something very important, so listen closely. Disco Dance Hall is your space to express yourself and move exactly the way that feels good to you. If it feels better to wiggle, move your hands, or close your eyes and just listen to the music, this is where we accept ALL of who we are, whatever that looks like! This space is all about moving your body in a way that feels unique to YOU. Now, I’m going to show you the moves if you want to dance, so follow my instructions!

_(Abe shows kids dance number choreographed by Ena)_

**ABE:** Now it’s OUR turn to dance! Are you ready?! Let’s do this! 3, 2, 1! _DANCE TIME!_

_(Abe & Rainbow Ray dance party!)_

**ABE:** Wow, that was so fun! Dancing helps me feel more like myself and that makes me so happy! And amigos, your dance moves are looking _great_ out there! I hope you’re having fun,  too. Thanks for dancing with us, Rainbow Ray!

**RAINBOW RAY:** Anytime, rain or shine! Thanks for coming to see me, Guncle Abe!

**ABE:** We’ll be back soon for another dance party—bye for now, Ray!

**RAINBOW RAY**: See you again soon, amigos! And peace out, Guncle Abe! Stay groovy! _(Rainbow Ray leaves)_

**ABE:** Wow, my body feels _so_ good after dancing! But now I’m a little tired and ready for some rest—and I know just the place! Let’s hop back on the Jolly Trolly to go visit my friend Otto the Owl in the Book Nook for storytime!

_(Interlude: Abe rides the Jolly Trolly)_

**OTTO THE OWL:** Good-day mate! A pleasure to see you, Guncle Abe!

**ABE:** Hi Otto! It’s so good to see you, too! Wow, it’s so cool in here! We’re in the trees!

**OTTO:** The view really is fantastic, I must say. I love watching the world from up here, you can learn a lot from taking in the whole forest.

**ABE:** Your Book Nook is so cozy, I love it! Have you read all the books in here?

**OTTO:** _(chuckling)_ Now that I think of it, Guncle Abe, I believe I _have_ read them all. I guess I really am that old, and hopefully all these books have made me wiser over time. It makes me so very happy to share them with you! There’s nothing in the world that brings me more joy than reading.

**ABE:** Otto, today we’re learning about frustration. Do you have any books about a time when things didn’t turn out the way they were supposed to?

**OTTO:** _(thinking)_ Mmmmm let me think…Let. Me. _think_—Ah! I know exactly the one! Now Guncle Abe, the book I’m thinking of was actually written by a friend of yours! And you know what? I have a surprise—she’s actually _here_! Oh Miss Klaraaaaa, come out come out, wherever you are!

_(Ms. Klara appears)_

**ABE:** Oh my goodness, Miss Klara! I can’t believe you’re here! You’re so brilliant, I can’t wait to listen to the book that you wrote!

**MS. KLARA:** Hi Guncle Abe! I’m so happy to be here at the Book Nook! And I’m really excited to read to you and your amigos. Thanks for having me!

**ABE:** Amigos, let’s all find a cozy spot to curl up and listen for story time! Grab a blanket and some pillows!

**MS. KLARA:** Today I’m going to read you _The Storm Inside_, a story about a bear named Ollie who goes on an adventure through stormy seas to find his grounding through breathing. Are you ready, amigos? Here we go.

_(Ms. Klara reads the book to Abe & amigos)_

**ABE:** Miss Klara, thank you so much for reading to us! I loved getting to know Ollie and learning how to stay calm through breathing, even when things don’t go the way we expected.

**MS. KLARA:** Oh Guncle Abe I’m so glad! And as always, so good to see you Otto! I always love coming to the Book Nook.

**ABE:** Bye for now, Otto! Bye Ms. Klara!

**OTTO:** See you later! Come back soon!

_(Otto & Ms. Klara disappear)_

**ABE:** Alright amigos, we have one more stop to make today so let’s hop back on the Jolly Trolly and head to the Affirmation Station!

_(Abe rides to Affirmation Station)_

**ABE:** My friend Queenie lives here at the Affirmation Station. _Isn’t it magical?_ Queenie teaches me how to love myself for _exactly_ who I am. _(Queenie appears)_ Hi Queenie!

**QUEENIE:** Oh hello, sweet Guncle Abe! It’s so good to see you.

**ABE:** Queenie, today we learned about feeling nervous—you always seem so calm, do you ever get nervous, Queenie?

**QUEENIE:** Guncle Abe, of course I get nervous sometimes! Everyone does. Sometimes I get nervous about saying the wrong thing when someone asks me for help or advice—I _definitely_ don’t know what to say sometimes!

**ABE:** Wow, if _you_ get nervous Queenie, then I really feel like it’s okay to feel that way!

**QUEENIE:** Of course, Guncle Abe! We’re all learning along the way. Are you ready for the affirmation I say to myself whenever I feel nervous?

**ABE:** I’d love to hear it, Queenie! But first, let’s put on our crowns & tiaras, amigos!

_(Abe tries on tiaras.)_

**ABE:** What do you think, Queenie?

**QUEENIE:** You look simply _divine_! You _all_ are glowing! I love seeing your crowns and tiaras, too, amigos! Now, here’s the affirmation, are you ready? Repeat after me: I am safe, I am calm, I can do this!

**ABE:** I am safe, I am calm, I can do this!

**QUEENIE:** Wonderful!

**ABE:** Now let’s say it again amigos, together this time!

**ABE & AMIGOS:** I am safe, I am calm, I can do this!

**ABE:** Thanks for that affirmation Queenie, I’m going to say it to help me remember that feeling nervous is totally okay, that a deep breath helps the butterflies fly away! Amigos, you can say this affirmation to yourself in the mirror or with your friends and loved ones!

**QUEENIE:** Yes yes yes, Guncle Abe! I love that. Bye amigos! Until next time, keep glowing!

**ABE:** Bye Queenie!

_(Abe waves to Queenie and takes off tiara.)_

**ABE:** Thanks amigos for joining me today at recess, where we let our true colors shine!
