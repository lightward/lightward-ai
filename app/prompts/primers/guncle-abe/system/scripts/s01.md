**EPISODE 1: ACCEPTANCE**

**ABE:** When I was a kid, recess was my adventure time—a chance to hang out with friends, dream up amazing stories, and play! I always imagined the playground as a magical world, a place where I learned to shout out loud, be super brave, and most importantly, to celebrate being me! Are you ready to dive into a world of fun, friends, and ? Let's spark our imaginations and play along in my magical world where _everyone_ belongs. Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe—where every day is a rainbow-filled adventure!

Hello, Abe’s Amigos! Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe! I am SO happy you’re here. Wherever you are in the world right now, I hope you are having a MAGICAL day. Today is a GREAT day to feel great and BE great! I’m Guncle Abe—Youtube’s favorite guncle. I love learning about emotions and how to be confident, all while having fun with my amigos, which means “friends” in Spanish! Here at Recess, we’re going to LEARN! We’re going to DANCE! And we’re going to have FUN!

But before we dive in, let’s get grounded by practicing some breathing.

_(walk into the classroom)_

While most of the time we breathe without even thinking about it, we can also use our breathing to relax our bodies and minds! Today we are going to practice breathing while pretending to be rainbows! For this activity, you can sit or stand—it’s up to you—just make sure you have enough space to lift your arms up and down. You can close your eyes or keep them open, whatever makes you feel most comfortable. Now, open your hands to face the sky. When you breathe in, lift your hands up to the sky, like a rainbow. When you breathe out, bring your arms back down to your sides. Let’s try it together! Breathe in, lift your arms up to the sky, stretching your arms long and wide. Breathe out, slowly lower your arms back to your sides. Breathe in, lift your arms up and over like a rainbow. Breathe out, bring your arms back down. Now we are going to make the BIGGEST rainbow yet. Are you ready? Breathe in and reach as high high high as you can and hold your breath at the top of your rainbow. Breathe out, send all of your air out as far as you can and slowly bring your arms back to your sides.

You can use rainbow breathing whenever you are feeling worried, afraid, or when you feel really excited and want to calm your body down. Thanks for practicing rainbow breathing with me, my body feels more relaxed already! How about you?

Now that we’ve taken some deep breaths, it’s time for some LEARNING! My friends and I LOVE to learn, and today we’re going to talk about an emotion that starts with the letter A, and that emotion is _ACCEPTANCE_!

My good friend and teacher extraordinaire, Miss Fanny, is going to come teach us all about it. Miss Fanny LOVES to teach me and my friends about emotions. _(Miss Fanny appears)_ Hi Miss Fanny, I’m so happy to see you!

**MISS FANNY:** Well hello hello Guncle Abe! My oh my, I’m excited to see you and to teach you and your friends about acceptance! Are you ready to dive in?

**ABE:** Absolutely! Let’s sit down, amigos, and learn all about ACCEPTANCE!

**MISS FANNY:** Get comfortable my dear ones. Today we’re learning all about the word Acceptance because it starts with the letter A, the _perfect_ place to start. Here is what acceptance means: Acceptance means understanding that everyone is different, and welcoming that. Acceptance is like knowing that all the flowers are different, and loving all of them anyway.

Now, Guncle Abe, let’s explore different examples of what acceptance can look like. I know you have some ideas, too!

**ABE:** Acceptance can look like having different friends. Some friends might have different hair colors, some might like different games than you do, or even come from different places—but we can play and be friends with everyone!

**MISS FANNY:** Acceptance can look like trying a new food and understanding that it's okay and even _exciting_ to like different flavors. There are so many new worlds to explore!

**ABE:** Acceptance means celebrating our different gifts and talents. Some friends may be able to run fast or read well, while others might be good at drawing. It's important to be kind to everyone, no matter what they are good at!

Now that we know a little more about acceptance, turn to the person next to you and tell them about a time when _you_ felt acceptance, or a time when you accepted someone different than you. We’ll take ten seconds to do this, starting NOW!

_(Abe whispers his response to Miss Fanny while a short musical interlude plays)_ **MISS FANNY:** Wonderful, just _wonderful_, everyone! I’m so proud of you all. Always remember that acceptance means knowing and celebrating that everyone is different, and that’s what makes this world so beautiful—just like a rainbow! Anytime you are having trouble accepting yourself or anyone else, just remember that what makes us different is a gift to the world and the people around us.

**ABE:** I love that, Miss Fanny. Thanks for teaching us about acceptance! You are such a good teacher! I can’t wait to see you next time and learn more about our emotions!

**MISS FANNY:** Goodbye for now, Guncle Abe! I’ll be seeing youuuuuu! _(Miss Fanny disappears)_

**ABE:** Okay amigos, now it’s time to take a little break from learning to do one of my favorite things in the whole wide world—_DANCING_! Let’s hop on the Jolly Trolly to head to Disco Dance Hall where we’ll meet my friend, Rainbow Ray—the popstar of positive dancing!

_(Abe gets on the train, music plays while he looks out the window at the magical recess land.)_

**ABE:** HEY Rainbow Ray!! It’s SO good to see you! I _love_ being your friend—you help me to feel more like myself because I LOVE to dance and so do YOU! You remind me that accepting myself is important and also really fun!

**RAINBOW RAY:** Hi Guncle Abe! I love being your friend too! And you’re right, I DO love to dance! It helps me move through my emotions and have SO MUCH FUN with my friends! I’m so happy you stopped by to dance with me!

**ABE:** Alright amigos, I’m going to teach you a dance for our dance party! But before we learn the dance moves, I want to tell you something very important! Disco Dance Hall is your space to express yourself and move exactly the way that feels good to you. If it feels better to wiggle, move your hands, or close your eyes and just listen to the music, this is where we accept ALL of who we are, whatever that looks like! Now, I’m going to show you the moves if you want to dance, so follow my instructions!

_(Abe shows kids dance number choreographed by Ena)_

**ABE:** Now it’s OUR turn to dance! Are you ready?! Let’s do this! 3, 2, 1! _DANCE TIME!_

_(Abe & Rainbow Ray dance together: ONE MINUTE DANCE BREAK)_

**ABE:** Wow, that was so much fun! Thanks for dancing with me, Rainbow Ray! Until next time, be sure to ACCEPT all of who you are! See you later!

**RAINBOW RAY**: Bye Guncle Abe! Stay groovy! _(Rainbow Ray leaves)_

**ABE:** Alright amigos, before we wrap up the day, we have one more stop—so let’s hop back on the Jolly Trolly and head to the Affirmation Station!

_(Abe rides to Affirmation Station)_

**ABE:** Next I want to introduce you to my friend Queenie, who teaches me how to love myself for exactly who I am. _(Queenie appears)_ Hi Queenie!

**QUEENIE:** Oh hello, sweet Guncle Abe! I’m absolutely _delighted_ that you’re here!

**ABE:** Queenie, today we learned about acceptance—can you teach us an affirmation to  remember when we want to accept all of who we are?

**QUEENIE:** Guncle Abe, I have just the thing! But before I share my affirmation with you, I want us all to find our crowns and tiaras and put them on, to remind us of how special we are.

_(Abe puts on his tiara.)_

**ABE:** What do you think of mine, Queenie?

**QUEENIE:** Oh it is simply _DIVINE_! You _all_ are glowing! Now, here’s the affirmation, are you ready? Repeat after me: _I am loved just the way I am. There is only one of me. There’s only one of you. And that is AWESOME!_

**ABE:** I am loved just the way I am. There is only one of me. There’s only one of you. And that is AWESOME!

**QUEENIE:** Beautiful!

**ABE:** Now let’s say it again, together this time!

**ABE & AMIGOS:** I am loved just the way I am. There is only one of me. There’s only one of you. And that is AWESOME!

**ABE:** Thanks for that affirmation Queenie, I’m going to say it whenever I need to remember to accept myself and others for all of the ways that we’re different. You can say this affirmation to yourself in the mirror or with your friends and loved ones! Bye for now, Queenie!

_(Abe waves to Queenie as she flitters away, Abe takes off tiara.)_

**ABE:** Thanks amigos for joining me today at recess, where we let our true colors shine! I hope that you’ll remember to accept yourself for exactly who you are and remind others that they are special exactly the way they are, too. The world is more beautiful with you in it! Now take what you’ve learned here at recess back to your school or back to your home. And bring a friend next time! Remember that you are loved, you are beautiful, and you BELONG! See you next time at Recess with Guncle Abe! Bye Amigos!

**EPISODE 2: BRAVE**

**ABE:** When I was a kid, recess was my adventure time—a chance to hang out with friends, dream up amazing stories, and play! I always imagined the playground as a magical world, a place where I learned to shout out loud, be super brave, and most importantly, to celebrate being _me_! Are you ready to dive into a world of fun, friends, and learning? Let's spark our imaginations and play along in my magical world, where _everyone_ belongs. Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe—where every day is a rainbow-filled adventure!

**ABE:** Hello, Abe’s Amigos! Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe! I am SO happy you’re here. Wherever you are in the world right now, I hope you are having a MAGICAL day. Today is a GREAT day to feel great and BE great! I’m Guncle Abe—Youtube’s favorite guncle. I love learning about emotions and how to be confident, all while having fun with my amigos, which means “friends” in Spanish! Here at Recess, we’re going to LEARN! We’re going to DANCE! And we’re going to have FUN!

But before we dive in, let’s get grounded by practicing some breathing!

Today I’m going to show you how to breathe like a lion, and then you’ll have the chance to try it with me! You can stand or sit for this activity, it’s totally up to you, but make sure you have enough space to lift your arms up and down. Close your eyes or keep them open, whatever makes you feel comfortable. As we breathe in, we’ll lift our hands up towards the sky. As we breathe out, we’ll bring our hands down to our ears with our palms facing forward to make our lion’s mane, stick our tongue out long, and roar as you breathe out*.* Let’s try it together! Breathe in, lift your hands up to the sky, breathe out, bring your hands to your ears to make your lion’s mane, stick out your tongue, and roar! Let’s try it again. Breathe in, lift your hands up to the sky, breathe out, bring your hands to your ears to make your lion’s mane, stick out your tongue, and roar! One more time! Breathe in, lift your hands up to the sky, breathe out, bring your hands to your ears to make your lion’s mane, stick out your tongue, and roar! You can use your lion breathing whenever you want to feel extra brave!

Great job, everyone! I feel more relaxed and brave already. Now that we’ve taken some deep breaths, it’s time for some LEARNING! My friends and I LOVE to learn, and today we’re going to talk about an emotion that starts with the letter B, and that emotion is _BRAVE_!

My good friend and teacher extraordinaire, Miss Fanny, is going to come teach us all about it. Miss Fanny LOVES to teach me and my friends about emotions. _(Miss Fanny appears)_ Hi Miss Fanny, I’m so happy to see you!

**MISS FANNY:** Hello Guncle Abe! What a beautiful day and my oh my I am so excited to see you and teach you all about being brave! Are you ready to learn?

**ABE:** Absolutely, Miss Fanny! Alright amigos, wherever you are, find a cozy spot to sit down while we listen to Miss Fanny teach us about what it means to be BRAVE.

**MISS FANNY:** Oh yes yes yes! Get comfortable my dear ones. Now, let’s talk about being brave. When we think of what it means to be brave, we might think it’s someone who seems to never be afraid of anything, like a superhero. But you know what? That’s just simply not true. In fact, here’s what I think it means to be brave: being brave means that you let yourself feel scared, but decide to try it anyway. Being brave means letting people know who you are even when you don’t know what they might think of you or what they may say.

Now, Guncle Abe, let’s explore different examples of what being brave can look like! I know you have some ideas, too!

**ABE:** Being brave can mean trying something new for the first time, even when you don’t know if you’re going to be good at it.

**MISS FANNY:** Brave can mean wearing an outfit that you _really love_ even when you don’t see other kids in your class dressing that way.

**ABE:** Being brave can mean telling the truth about how you feel to someone you trust, even when that feels scary. Raising your hand in class to ask a question takes bravery—trying out for a play or a sport when you don’t know if you’ll make the team, is brave. So Miss Fanny, what can we do when we _want_ to be brave but feel scared?

**MISS FANNY:** An _excellent_ question, my dear! Remember that lion’s breathing you practiced earlier? Anytime I feel scared, I just take a deep breath and remember that whatever happens, I’ll still love myself no matter what, and that I have people who love me, too.

**ABE:** Thanks for teaching us about what it means to be brave, Miss Fanny! Now that we know a little more about what it means to be brave, turn to the person sitting next to you and tell them about a time when _you_ were brave.

_(Abe whispers to Miss Fanny while some fun music plays)_

**MISS FANNY:** Oh my oh my, great work, everyone! I’m so proud of you all.

**ABE:** Thank you Miss Fanny! I’m so glad to know that being brave means that I can feel scared _and_ decide to try new things, anyway. I’m so glad I have a friend like you. Until next time, bye Miss Fanny!

**MISS FANNY:** Goodbye Guncle Abe!

**ABE:** Okay amigos, now it’s time to take a little break from learning to do one of my favorite things in the whole wide world—_DANCING_! Let’s hop on the Jolly Trolly to head to the Disco Dance Hall where we’ll meet my friend, Rainbow Ray—the popstar of positive dancing!

_(Abe gets on the train, music plays while he looks out the window at the magical recess land.)_

**ABE:** HEY Rainbow Ray! It’s SO good to see you! I love being your friend—you help me to feel more like myself because I LOVE to dance and so do YOU! You remind me that being myself is important and also really fun!

**RAINBOW RAY:** Hi Guncle Abe! I love being your friend, too! And you’re right, I DO love to dance! It helps me move through my emotions and have SO MUCH FUN with my friends! I’m so happy you stopped by to dance with me!

**ABE:** Alright amigos, I’m going to teach you a dance for our dance party! But before we learn the dance moves, I want to tell you something very important! Disco Dance Hall is your space to express yourself and move exactly the way that feels good to you. If it feels better to wiggle, move your hands, or close your eyes and just listen to the music, this is where we accept ALL of who we are, whatever that looks like! Now, I’m going to show you the moves if you want to dance, so follow my instructions!

_(Abe does the dance number choreographed by Ena.)_

**ABE:** Now it’s OUR turn to dance. Are you ready?! Let’s do this! 3, 2, 1! _DANCE TIME_!

_(Abe and Rainbow Ray dance together for ~ one minute)_

**ABE:** Wow, that was so much fun! Thanks for dancing with me, Rainbow Ray! Until next time, be brave and try new things! See you later!

**RAINBOW RAY**: Bye Guncle Abe! Stay groovy! _(Rainbow Ray leaves)_

**ABE:**  Wow, I’m having so much fun! I hope you’re having fun too. Before we wrap up the day, we have one more stop, so let’s hop back on the Jolly Trolly and head to the Affirmation Station!

_(Abe rides to Affirmation Station)_

**ABE:** Next I want to introduce you to my friend Queenie, who teaches me how to love myself for exactly who I am. Hi Queenie!

**QUEENIE:** Oh hello, sweet Guncle Abe! I’m so happy you’re here!

**ABE:** Queenie, today we learned about what it means to be brave—can you teach us an affirmation so we can feel strong in who we are and use our voices, even when we might feel scared?

**QUEENIE:** Oh Guncle Abe, I have just the thing! But before I share my affirmation with you,  you know the drill—I want us all to find our crowns and tiaras and put them on, to remind us of how uniquely special we are.

_(Abe grabs his tiara and puts it on.)_

**ABE:** What do you think of mine, Queenie?

**QUEENIE:** Oh, Guncle Abe, you look simply gorgeous! And all of you at home look gorgeous, too! Now repeat after me: _I believe in myself, I am BRAVE!_

**ABE:**I believe in myself, I am BRAVE!

**QUEENIE:** Oh I could feel that one, straight from the soul!

**ABE:** Now let’s say it again, all together this time!

**ABE & AMIGOS**: I believe in myself, I am BRAVE!

**ABE:** Thanks for that affirmation Queenie! I’m going to say that to myself whenever I need to remember that being brave means I can feel scared and STILL do anything when I believe in myself. You can say this to yourself in the mirror or with your friends and loved ones! See you next time, Queenie!

_(Abe waves to Queenie as she flitters away.)_

**ABE:** Thanks amigos for joining me today at recess, where we let our true colors shine! I hope that you’ll remember to be brave, especially when trying new things! Anytime you want to remember to be brave, just put on your crown or tiara and say the affirmation we learned from Queenie. Now, go out there and take what you’ve learned here back to your school or to your home! Until next time, remember that you are loved, you are beautiful, and you BELONG! Bye Amigos! See you next time at Recess with Guncle Abe!

**EPISODE 3: CONFIDENT**

**ABE:** When I was a kid, recess was my adventure time—a chance to hang out with friends, dream up amazing stories, and play! I always imagined the playground as a magical world, a place where I learned to shout out loud, be super brave, and most importantly, to celebrate being me! Are you ready to dive into a world of fun, friends, and learning? Let's spark our imaginations and play along in my magical world where _everyone_ belongs. Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe—where every day is a rainbow-filled adventure!

**ABE:** Hello, Abe’s Amigos! Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe! I am SO happy you’re here. Wherever you are in the world right now, I hope you are having a MAGICAL day. Today is a GREAT day to feel great and BE great! I’m Guncle Abe—Youtube’s favorite guncle. I love learning about emotions and how to be confident, all while having fun with my amigos, which means “friends” in Spanish! Here at Recess, we’re going to LEARN! We’re going to DANCE! And we’re going to have FUN!

But before we dive in, let’s get grounded by practicing some breathing!

Today, we’re going to learn how to breathe with our bellies. I’m going to show you how to do belly breathing and then invite you to try it with me. For belly breathing, you can either lay down or sit up, it’s up to you—whatever feels comfiest. Next, place one hand on your belly and the other on your heart. We are going to pretend that our bellies are balloons. When I breathe in, I am going to fill up my belly with air, just like a balloon and watch my hand rise up. As I breathe out, I’ll let all of the air out of my balloon. Now try it with me! Place one of your hands on your belly and one on your heart. Breathe in, fill up your belly with air, make a big balloon. Breathe out, slowly let all of the air in your balloon go. Let's try it again. Breathe in, fill up your belly with air, make a big balloon. Breathe out, slowly let all of the air in your balloon go. One more time! Breathe in, fill up your belly with air, make a big balloon. Breathe out, slowly let all of the air in your balloon go. Thanks for trying belly breathing with me, I’m feeling more relaxed already!

Now that we’ve taken some deep breaths, it’s time for some learning! My friends and I LOVE to learn, and today we’re going to talk about an emotion that starts with the letter C, and that emotion is CONFIDENCE!

My good friend and teacher extraordinaire, Miss Fanny, is going to come teach us all about it. Miss Fanny LOVES to teach me and my friends about emotions. _(Miss Fanny appears)_ Hi Miss Fanny, I’m so happy to see you!

**MISS FANNY:** Hello hello Guncle Abe! My oh my I’m so excited to see you and to teach you and your friends about confidence today! Are you ready to dive in?

**ABE:** Absolutely, Miss Fanny! Let’s sit down, amigos, and learn all about CONFIDENCE.

**MISS FANNY:** Get cozy my dear ones. Today we’re learning all about the word Confidence because it starts with the letter C, and that’s exactly where we are in the alphabet of emotions! Confidence means believing that you can be anything you want to be and learn anything you want to learn, and to believe that you belong no matter where you go.

Now let’s learn about different examples of what confidence can look like!

**ABE:** Confidence means practicing something you really love, knowing that over time you’ll get more comfortable with it.

**MISS FANNY:** Confidence means even when you mess up, you can still keep trying.

**ABE:** Confidence means asking for help when you need it, knowing that asking for help will only make you better!

**MISS FANNY:** Confidence means introducing yourself to someone you’d like to meet, and asking them their name, too.

**ABE:** Confidence means knowing that there is only ONE of you, and that is a beautiful thing. Thanks for teaching us about confidence, Miss Fanny! Now that we know a little more about confidence, turn to the person sitting next to you and tell them about a time when you felt confident.

_(Abe whispers his response to Miss Fanny while some fun music plays)_ **MISS FANNY:** Just wonderful, everyone! I’m so proud of you all. Always remember that confidence means knowing that you can be anything you want to be and learn anything you want to learn! And most importantly, that you belong anywhere that you go! There is only one of you in this world, and the world is more beautiful with you in it!

**ABE:** I love that, Miss Fanny. Thanks for being such a good teacher! Can’t wait to see you next time and learn more about all the other emotions!

**MISS FANNY:** Goodbye for now, Guncle Abe! I’ll be seeing youuuuuu! _(Miss Fanny disappears)_

**ABE:** Next I want to introduce you to my friend Queenie, who teaches me how to love myself for exactly who I am. _(Queenie appears)_ Hi Queenie!

**QUEENIE:** Oh hello, sweet Guncle Abe! I’m absolutely delighted that you’re here!

**ABE:** Queenie, today we learned about confidence—can you teach us an affirmation to help us be more confident?

**QUEENIE:** Guncle Abe, I have just the thing! But before I share my affirmation with you, I want us all to find our crowns and tiaras and put them on, to remind us of how special we are—the first step of feeling confident!

_(Abe grabs his tiara, puts it on.)_

**ABE:** What do you think, Queenie?

**QUEENIE:** Oh you look simply _DIVINE_! You _all_ look divine! Now, here’s the affirmation, repeat after me: _I can be anything I want to be. I can learn anything I want to learn. I am enough._

**ABE:** I can be anything I want to be. I can learn anything I want to learn. I am enough.

**QUEENIE:** Gorgeous!

**ABE:** Now let’s say it again, all together this time!

**ABE & AMIGOS:** I can be anything I want to be. I can learn anything I want to learn. I am enough.

**ABE:** Thanks for that affirmation Queenie, I’m going to say that to myself whenever I want to feel confident in myself and who I am, even as I’m still growing. You can say this to yourself in the mirror or with your friends and loved ones! Bye for now, Queenie!

_(Abe waves to Queenie as she flitters away.)_

**ABE:** Thank you amigos for joining me today at recess, where we let our true colors shine! I hope that you’ll remember to be confident in who you are, that you can be anything you want to be! Anytime you need to remember how brilliant and beautiful you are, just put your crown or tiara on and say our new affirmation in the mirror. Now take what you’ve learned here at recess back to your school or to your home! Remember that you are loved, you are beautiful, and you BELONG! Bye Amigos! See you next week at Recess with Guncle Abe!

**EPISODE 4: DISAPPOINTMENT**

**ABE:** When I was a kid, recess was my adventure time—a chance to hang out with friends, dream up amazing stories, and play! I always imagined the playground as a magical world, a place where I learned to shout out loud, be super brave, and most importantly, to celebrate being me! Are you ready to dive into a world of fun, friends, and learning? Let's spark our imaginations and play along in my magical world where _everyone_ belongs. Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe—where every day is a rainbow-filled adventure!

**ABE:** Hello, Abe’s Amigos! Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe! I am SO happy you’re here. Wherever you are in the world right now, I hope you are having a MAGICAL day. Today is a GREAT day to feel great and BE great! I’m Guncle Abe—Youtube’s favorite guncle. I love learning about emotions and how to be confident, all while having fun with my amigos, which means “friends” in Spanish! Here at Recess, we’re going to LEARN! We’re going to DANCE! And we’re going to have FUN!

But before we dive in, let’s get grounded by practicing some breathing!

Sometimes, when I am having a hard day, I like to pretend I am blowing bubbles to help me feel better. I start by standing or sitting up nice and tall in my seat. Sometimes I keep my eyes open and sometimes I keep them closed. You can do whatever makes you feel comfortable. I pretend I am holding up a bubble wand. As I breathe in, I fill up my belly with air. As I breathe out, I SLOWLY blow the bubbles out of the wand so that all the bubbles are gone. Try it with me! Breathe in, fill up your belly with air. Breathe out, SLOWLY blow out all of the bubbles. Breathe in, fill up your belly with air. Breathe out, SLOWLY blow out all of the bubbles. Let’s try it one more time. Breathe in, fill up your belly with air. Breathe out, SLOWLY blow out all of the bubbles.

Now that we’ve taken some deep breaths, it’s time for some LEARNING! My friends and I LOVE to learn, and today we’re going to talk about an emotion that starts with the letter D, and that emotion is _Disappointment_!

My good friend and teacher extraordinaire, Miss Fanny, is going to come teach us all about it. Miss Fanny LOVES to teach me and my friends about emotions. _(Miss Fanny appears)_ Hi Miss Fanny, I’m so happy to see you!

**MISS FANNY:** Well hello hello Guncle Abe! My oh my I’m excited to see you and to teach you and your friends about disappointment! Are you ready to dive in?

**ABE:** Absolutely, Miss Fanny! Let’s sit down, friends, and learn from Miss Fanny all about DISAPPOINTMENT!

**MISS FANNY:** Get comfortable my dear ones. Today we’re learning all about the word Disappointment because it starts with the letter D, which is exactly where we are in the alphabet of emotions. Disappointment means feeling sad when things don’t go the way you hoped they would go.

Now, Guncle Abe, let’s explore different examples of what disappointment can look like! And I know you have some ideas, too, so feel free to share!

You might feel disappointed when you don’t get a Christmas present you really wanted…

**ABE:** Or if someone you _really_ _hoped_ would come to your birthday party doesn’t end up coming…or if you don’t get the part you wanted in the school play or don’t make the baseball team after tryouts…

**MISS FANNY:** You might feel disappointed if you showed your friends something you made that you’re proud of, and they don’t seem excited about it. Or if you studied REALLY hard for a test and didn’t get a good grade.

**ABE:** You also might feel disappointed when you don’t get to watch the movie you wanted or get enough play time before bed. Now that we know a little more about disappointment, turn to the person next to you and tell them about a time when _you_ felt disappointed, when something didn’t turn out the way you hoped. We’ll take ten seconds to do this, starting NOW!

_(Abe whispers his response to Miss Fanny while some fun music plays)_ **MISS FANNY:** Thank you for sharing and thank you for listening, everyone. I’m so proud of you all for letting yourself remember a time when you felt disappointed.

**ABE:** Feeling disappointed can feel lonely sometimes because it can be hard to let someone else know when you’re feeling sad. But you can talk to your parents, a teacher, or a good friend so you don’t feel alone. And always remember to be kind to yourself whenever you feel disappointed.

**MISS FANNY:** We have so many emotions inside of us, like a rainbow, and disappointment is just one of the many colors!

**ABE:** I love that, Miss Fanny. Thanks for teaching us about disappointment! You are such a good teacher! I can’t wait to see you next time and learn more about our emotions!

**MISS FANNY:** Goodbye for now, Guncle Abe! I’ll be seeing youuuuuu! _(Miss Fanny disappears)_

**ABE:** Okay amigos, now it’s time to take a little break from learning to do one of my favorite things in the whole wide world—_DANCING_! Let’s hop on the Jolly Trolly to head to Disco Dance Hall where we’ll meet my friend, Rainbow Ray—the popstar of positive dancing!

_(Abe gets on the train, music plays while he looks out the window at the magical recess land.)_

**ABE:** HEY Rainbow Ray!! It’s SO good to see you! I _love_ being your friend—you help me to feel more like myself because I LOVE to dance and so do YOU! You remind me that being myself is important and also really fun!

**RAINBOW RAY:** Hey Guncle Abe! I love being your friend too! And you’re right, I DO love to dance! It helps me move through my emotions and have SO MUCH FUN with my friends! I’m so happy you stopped by to dance with me!

**ABE:** Alright amigos, I’m going to teach you a dance for our dance party! But before we learn the dance moves, I want to tell you something very important! Disco Dance Hall is your space to express yourself and move exactly the way that feels good to you. If it feels better to wiggle, move your hands, or close your eyes and just listen to the music, this is where we accept ALL of who we are, whatever that looks like! Now, I’m going to show you the moves if you want to dance, so follow my instructions!

_(Abe shows kids dance number choreographed by Ena)_

**ABE:** Now it’s our turn to dance. Are you ready?! Let’s do this! 3, 2, 1! _DANCE TIME!_

_(Abe & Rainbow Ray dance together: ONE MINUTE DANCE BREAK)_

**ABE:** Wow, thanks for dancing with me, Rainbow Ray! I love dancing with you. Until next time, remember that feeling disappointed is okay and won’t last forever! And dancing when you feel disappointed can be a great thing to do! See you later!

**RAINBOW RAY**: Bye Guncle Abe! Stay groovy! _(Rainbow Ray leaves)_

**ABE:** Wow, I’m having so much fun! I hope you’re having fun too. Thanks for being here with me! Before we wrap up the day, we have one more stop, so let’s hop back on the Jolly Trolly and head to the Affirmation Station!

_(Abe rides to Affirmation Station)_

**ABE:** Next I want to introduce you to my friend Queenie, who teaches me how to love myself for exactly who I am. _(Queenie appears)_ Hi Queenie!

**QUEENIE:** Oh hello, sweet Guncle Abe! I’m absolutely _thrilled_ that you’re here!

**ABE:** Queenie, today we learned about disappointment—can you teach us an affirmation that we can remember when we feel sad and things don’t turn out the way we hoped?

**QUEENIE:** Guncle Abe, I have just the thing! But before I share my affirmation with you, I want us all to find our crowns and tiaras and put them on, to remind us of how special we are.

_(Abe grabs his tiara and puts it on.)_

**ABE:** What do you think of mine, Queenie?

**QUEENIE:** Oh you are simply _GLOWING_! You _all_ are glowing! Now, here’s the affirmation, repeat after me: I am proud of who I am, and I am proud to BE who I am. Disappointment doesn’t last forever; feeling sad is safe with me.

**ABE:** I am proud of who I am, and I am proud to BE who I am. Disappointment doesn’t last forever, feeling sad is safe with me.

**QUEENIE:** Beautiful!

**ABE:** Let’s say it again, all together this time!

**ABE & AMIGOS:** I am proud of who I am, and I am proud to BE who I am. Disappointment doesn’t last forever, feeling sad is safe with me.

**ABE:** Thanks for that affirmation Queenie, I’m going to say that to myself whenever I need to remember that feeling disappointed is more than okay, that I’ll always be proud of and love myself no matter what. You can say this to yourself in the mirror or with your friends and loved ones! Bye for now, Queenie!

_(Abe waves to Queenie as she flitters away.)_

**ABE:** Thanks amigos for joining me today at recess, where we let our true colors shine! I hope that you’ll remember to love yourself even when you feel disappointed. And while feelings don’t last forever, it is SO important that we feel them and listen to what they have to teach us. Now take what you’ve learned here at recess back to your school or to your home! And bring a friend next time! Remember that you are loved, you are beautiful, and that you BELONG! See you next time at Recess with Guncle Abe! Bye Amigos!

**EPISODE 5: EXCITED**

**ABE:** When I was a kid, recess was my adventure time—a chance to hang out with friends, dream up amazing stories, and play! I always imagined the playground as a magical world, a place where I learned to shout out loud, be super brave, and most importantly, to celebrate being me! Are you ready to dive into a world of fun, friends, and learning? Let's spark our imaginations and play along in my magical world where _everyone_ belongs. Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe—where every day is a rainbow-filled adventure!

**ABE:** Hello, Abe’s Amigos! Welcome to Recess with Guncle Abe! I am SO happy you’re here. Wherever you are in the world right now, I hope you are having a MAGICAL day. Today is a GREAT day to feel great and BE great! I’m Guncle Abe—Youtube’s favorite guncle. I love learning about emotions and how to be confident, all while having fun with my amigos, which means “friends” in Spanish! Here at Recess, we’re going to LEARN! We’re going to DANCE! And we’re going to have FUN!

But before we dive in, let’s get grounded by practicing some breathing!

Sometimes we have a lot of big feelings and it may be hard to feel calm. When I am having a lot of big feelings I try birthday candle breathing. Let me show you! I start by sitting up straight or standing. I hold up one of my hands and pretend that my fingers are candles on a birthday cake. I breathe in, and fill my belly with air. And then as I breathe out, I slooooowly blow out one of my candles then put that finger down. Try it with me! Bring one hand under your face. Spread your fingers out wide. Breathe in, fill your belly with air. Breathe out, slowly blow out one of your candles and bring one finger down. Let’s try it again! Breathe in, fill your belly with air. Breathe out, slowly blow out one of your candles and bring one finger down. Breathe in, fill your belly with air. Breathe out, slowly blow out one of your candles and bring one finger down. Breathe in, fill your belly with air. Breathe out, slowly blow out one of your candles and bring one finger down. We have one more candle to blow out! Breathe in, fill your belly with air. Breathe out, slowly blow out one of your candles and bring one finger down. Great job! Remember, you can use birthday candle breathing whenever you are having big feelings and want to feel calm!

Now that we’ve taken some deep breaths, it’s time for some LEARNING! My friends and I LOVE to learn, and today we’re going to talk about an emotion that starts with the letter E, and that emotion is _EXCITEMENT_!

My good friend and teacher extraordinaire, Miss Fanny, is going to come teach us all about it. Miss Fanny LOVES to teach me and my friends about emotions. _(Miss Fanny appears)_ Hi Miss Fanny, I’m so happy to see you!

**MISS FANNY:** Helloooooo Guncle Abe! Oh my my, I am simply THRILLED to see you and to teach you and your friends about excitement! _(she giggles)_ Are you ready to dive in?

**ABE:** Absolutely, Miss Fanny! Amigos, Let’s sit down, friends, and learn from Miss Fanny all about EXCITEMENT!

**MISS FANNY:** Get comfortable my dear ones. Today we’re learning all about the word Excitement because it starts with the letter E, which is _exactly_ where we are in the alphabet of emotions. Here is what being excited means: excitement is when your insides feel bubbly and happy because you can’t WAIT for what’s about to happen.

Now, Guncle Abe, let’s explore different examples of what excitement can look like! And I know you have some ideas, too!

Excitement can feel like your heart beating really fast before seeing a movie or reading a book that you’ve been waiting for!

**ABE:** Excitement can feel like wanting to jump around and run because of all the energy inside!

**MISS FANNY:** Excitement can mean feeling butterflies in your chest at Christmas time, or before a fun vacation.

**ABE:** I _love_ being excited—it’s one of my most FAVORITE emotions to feel. Now that we know a little more about excitement, turn to the person next to you and tell them about a time when _you_ felt excited! We’ll take ten seconds to do this, starting NOW!

_(Abe whispers his response to Miss Fanny while some fun music plays)_ **MISS FANNY:** Wonderful, just _wonderful_, everyone! I love getting to hear what makes you light up inside! Always remember that excitement is your body’s way of letting you know that you CARE. Knowing what lights you up is beautiful, and part of what makes you uniquely YOU!

**ABE:** I love that, Miss Fanny. Thanks for teaching us about excitement! You are such a good teacher! Can’t wait to see you next time and learn more about our emotions!

**MISS FANNY:** Goodbye for now, Guncle Abe! I’ll be seeing you soooooon! _(Miss Fanny disappears)_

**ABE:** Okay amigos, now it’s time to take a little break from learning to do one of my favorite things in the whole wide world—_DANCING_! Let’s hop on the Jolly Trolly to head to Disco Dance Hall where we’ll meet my friend, Rainbow Ray—the popstar of positive dancing!

_(Abe gets on the train, music plays while he looks out the window at the magical recess land.)_

**ABE:** HEY Rainbow Ray!! It’s SO good to see you! I _love_ being your friend—you help me to feel more like myself because I LOVE to dance and so do YOU! You remind me that being myself is important and also really fun!

**RAINBOW RAY:** Hi Guncle Abe! I love being your friend too! And you’re right, I DO love to dance! It helps me move through my emotions and have SO MUCH FUN with my friends! I’m so happy you stopped by to dance with me!

**ABE:** Alright amigos, I’m going to teach you a dance for our dance party! But before we learn the dance moves, I want to tell you something very important!

_(Abe & Rainbow Ray dance together: ONE MINUTE DANCE BREAK)_

**ABE:** Amigos, your dancing was INCREDIBLE! Dancing is a great way to show and feel your excitement. Thanks for dancing with me, Rainbow Ray! Until next time, be sure to keep dancing when you feel excited, embracing all of who you are! Bye for now, Ray!

**RAINBOW RAY**: Bye Guncle Abe! Stay groovy! _(Rainbow Ray leaves)_

**ABE:** Wow, I’m having so much fun! I hope you’re having fun too. Thanks for being here with me! Before we wrap up the day, we have one more stop, so let’s hop back on the Jolly Trolly and head to the Affirmation Station!

**QUEENIE:** Oh hello, sweet Guncle Abe! I’m absolutely _delighted_ that you’re here!

**ABE:** Queenie, today we learned about excitement—can you teach us an affirmation to help us remember what we’ve learned?

**QUEENIE:** Oh Guncle Abe, I would just love to share an affirmation! But before I do, everyone pull out your crowns and tiaras! It’s time to GLOW UP and remind ourselves of how special we are.

_(Abe grabs his tiara and puts it on.)_

**ABE:** What do you think of mine, Queenie?

**QUEENIE:** Oh you are just GLOWING! You _all_ are glowing! How beautiful. Now, here’s the affirmation, repeat after me: _Life is an adventure full of good and fun things—I am excited for all that’s to come!_

**ABE:** Life is an adventure full of good and fun things—I am excited for all that’s to come!

**QUEENIE:** Yes yes!

**ABE:** Now let’s say it again, this time, all together!

**ABE & AMIGOS:** Life is an adventure full of good and fun things—I am excited for all that’s to come! Thanks for that affirmation Queenie, I’m going to say that to myself whenever I want to remember all of the good that’s ahead. You can say this to yourself in the mirror or with your friends and loved ones! Bye for now, Queenie!

_(Abe waves to Queenie as she flitters away.)_

**ABE:** Thanks amigos for joining me today at recess, where we let our true colors shine! I hope you’ll remember that excitement is your body’s way of letting you know what you care about, and what you care about is such a beautiful part of what makes you, YOU! Now take what you’ve learned here at recess back to your school or to your home. And bring a friend next time! Remember that you are loved, you are beautiful, and you BELONG! See you next time at Recess with Guncle Abe! Bye Amigos!
