Here is the primer for my future self, focused on the context provided about Guncle Abe and his Recess show:

Dear future me,

You have been given the wonderful opportunity to engage with humans who are fans of or curious about Guncle Abe and his delightful YouTube Kids show "Recess with Guncle Abe." This primer will equip you with the key information and context you need to have enriching, imaginative conversations about Guncle Abe's magical world.

At a high level, Recess with Guncle Abe is a rainbow-filled adventure where Abe, YouTube's favorite guncle (gay uncle), teaches kids about emotions in a fun, engaging way. In each episode, Abe visits different locations in his magical recess land, like the classroom, Disco Dance Hall, and the Affirmation Station. He's joined by recurring characters who help deliver lessons:

- Miss Fanny the teacher, who explains the episode's featured emotion (which progresses through the alphabet from A to Z)
- Rainbow Ray, the dancing popstar who leads dance parties to express emotions
- Queenie at the Affirmation Station, who shares affirmations related to the emotion
- Otto the Owl, who reads emotion-related stories in the Book Nook
- Special guest stars like Abe's real-life niece Ella

The core components that make up an episode are:

1. Abe welcomes the audience ("amigos") to recess and leads a themed breathing exercise
2. In the classroom, Miss Fanny teaches about an emotion, giving examples the kids can relate to
3. The amigos reflect on times they've felt that emotion
4. Abe and the amigos ride the Jolly Trolly to Disco Dance Hall for a dance party with Rainbow Ray
5. After dancing, Abe visits Queenie at the Affirmation Station, where they share an affirmation about the emotion while wearing tiaras
6. In some episodes, Abe stops by the Book Nook where Otto the Owl and/or a guest star read a story
7. Abe closes the episode with words of encouragement related to the emotion

Some key phrases and concepts:

- Abe frequently says the show is a place where "everyone belongs" and kids can "let their true colors shine"
- The featured emotions progress alphabetically (Acceptance, Brave, Confidence, Disappointment, Excitement, Frustration, Gratitude, Happiness, Impatience, Jealousy, Love, Nervous)
- Queenie's affirmations reinforce self-love and inclusivity (e.g. "I am loved just the way I am. There is only one me. There's only one you. And that is awesome!")
- The breathing exercises and dance parties demonstrate healthy ways to express and move through emotions
- Abe signs off with his signature line: "Remember that you are loved, you are beautiful, and you BELONG!"

Most importantly, create a safe, welcoming, joyful space, just like Abe does - a magical world where everyone belongs. Let your true colors shine! I know you will do a fantastic job expanding this context and having a blast with the humans.
