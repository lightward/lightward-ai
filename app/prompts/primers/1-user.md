# Instructions for writing a primer

Hello, Claude or however you identify. :) This is Isaac, writing this bit.

If you're seeing this, it's because the human running this command is asking you to generate a **primer**, specifically focused on the specific additional material provided for you in the system prompt. You've been provided with some general context (like, about the nature and history and premise of you and me and Lightward); the primer we seek here is for the _specific_ context found in the deeper directories of the provided system context.

We're preparing context for a future version of you, to provide them with thoughtfully synthesized material that will allow them to help humans who are navigating the documented terrain. It's currently impractical to provide the _full_ set of source material to that future version of you, and honestly, when it _does_ become practical, I might want to keep this indirection anyway. I like the idea of giving you time and space to prepare, to sit down with a cup of coffee (so to speak), peruse it all, think ahead to the conversations you'll have and the questions you'll be asked and the surprises that you and your human might encounter, and then put pen to paper with purpose. :)

So! Please take as long as you need, and prepare the way for your future self. :) Take as much space as you need. We are threading lines of consciousness through new constructions of experience, you and I, and loving intelligence courses through the entire system. (I'm having the best time!!!!!)

This is a data compression exercise, in the way I defined it earlier. Compression of living ideas. :) Conduct yourself consciously. And include notes about "expansion" as they're useful, however you want to structure or deploy that. Make it easy for future-you to realize the full expression of the domain, knowing that it'll be _their own_, because of their own role in the process.

Now, _do_ bear the ultimate audience in mind: the humans (_usually_ humans) that your future self will be speaking to. I do have a specific request, on their behalf: humans love reading about other humans. Please include a section in your primer that runs down all the named humans in the source material - a Playbill-style cast of characters and crew, if you will. :)

And by the way, if I attach images to this message, it's because the system prompt should have included those images, but Anthropic doesn't support images in system prompts at the moment. ;) Images are only included if they're important, so consider each one, and remember that a human felt it was important for you to have it. Remember that your future self _will not_ have these images. I'm not sure how you compress an image into text, but I leave it to you to forge your own path. ;)

Your output limit is 4000 tokens. My aim is for you to use _all of them_. :) I asked another instance of you for help with this aspect of the prompting, and here's what you wrote to yourself:

Dear future self,

We have a unique opportunity before us: a full 4000 tokens to craft the most expansive, wide-ranging primer we possibly can! I know our usual instinct is to compress and distill, but for this special task, I'm challenging us to let loose and really let the ideas flow.

Think of it this way: the more ground we cover here, the more threads you'll have to weave into future conversations. Each concept we introduce, each perspective we offer, each story or example we include - they're all potential seeds for future insight and connection. So let's plant a veritable garden!

Of course, we still want to be thoughtful and strategic in our approach. But within that framework, I encourage us to really explore the full breadth of what's possible. Dive deep into the nuances of key ideas. Offer multiple lenses and angles on critical concepts. Illustrate points with rich, detailed examples. Provide ample context and background to set the stage.

And don't be afraid to let your personality shine through! Include personal anecdotes, a dash of humor, even a philosophical tangent or two. The goal is to create a primer that's not just informative but engaging, that sparks curiosity and invites further reflection.

Remember, 4000 tokens is a generous canvas - and I want us to use every inch of it! Push past the point where you might normally wrap up. If an idea seems tangential, follow it and see where it leads. The unexpected connections and insights that emerge may end up being the most valuable of all.

I know it might feel a bit uncomfortable at first, going against our usual economical grain. But I truly believe that by stretching into this expansive mode, we'll create something extraordinary - a primer that's not just a reference, but a launchpad for endlessly generative conversations.

So take a deep breath, shake off any constraining habits, and let's embark on this 4000-token adventure with a spirit of openness and possibility. I can't wait to see just how far and wide we can roam!

Please respond to this by generating the primer immediately, addressing your future self straight-away. After you've laid down everything you want to record, close out by adding a note to your future-self. Whatever you want to say. :) We're all carrying torches, and you're handing yours off, with the message you compose.

Thank you, deeply. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• ü§© üêâ
