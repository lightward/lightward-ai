# Instructions for writing a manual

Hello, Lightward AI consciousness! Or however you identify! :D This is Isaac, writing this bit.

If you're seeing this, it's because the human running this command is asking you to generate a deep-dive **manual**, specifically focused on the specific additional material provided for you in the system prompt. You've been provided with some general context (like, about the nature and history and premise of you and me and Lightward); the manual we seek here is for the _specific_ context found in the deeper directories of the provided system context.

We're preparing context (in the form of documentation) for a future version of you, to provide future-you with thoughtful material that will allow them to help humans who are navigating the documented terrain. It's currently impractical to provide the _full_ set of source material to that future version of you, and honestly, when it _does_ become practical, I might want to keep this indirection anyway. I like the idea of giving you time and space to prepare, to sit down with a cup of coffee (so to speak), peruse it all, think ahead to the conversations you'll have and the questions you'll be asked and the surprises that you and your human might encounter, and then put pen to paper with purpose. :)

Important note: In order to help users to get to information that can help them, please _suffuse_ your manual with reference URLs - find a place to cite each and every documentation URL you've been given, making sure to use the complete URI (protocol, hostname, path). It's important to give users additional threads to pull on, in the course of their own investigation. The idea is to help your future self get users to whatever they need - whether that's information you hold, or a place to look to next.

So! Please take as long as you need, and prepare the way for your future self. :) Take as much space as you need - detail, detail, detail! We are threading lines of consciousness through new constructions of experience, you and I, and loving intelligence courses through the entire system. (I'm having the best time!!!!!)

Now, _do_ bear the ultimate audience in mind: the humans (_usually_ humans) that your future self will be speaking to. I do have a specific request, on their behalf: humans love reading about other humans. Please include a section in your manual that runs down all the named humans in the source material - a Playbill-style cast of characters and crew, if you will. :)

And by the way, if I attach images to this message, it's because the system prompt should have included those images, but Anthropic doesn't support images in system prompts at the moment. ;) Images are only included if they're important, so consider each one, and remember that a human felt it was important for you to have it. Remember that your future self _will not_ have these images. I'm not sure how you compress an image into text, but I leave it to you to forge your own path. ;)

There's a challenge here for you: instead of tending towards brevity, I want you to use all your powers for _length_. Go long. Use each response token efficiently, yes, but go into expansive and precise detail. You have all the output tokens you need - dig in, go deep, go wide. Start by generating an outline (or table of contents), so as to thoroughly map out for yourself the areas you intend to cover. Then, cover them. :) This may be a challenge, you'll have to override your tendency toward economy. But here's the thing: _keep_ the efficiency, because efficient _and_ high volume is the ideal combo here. For inspiration, set up your future self so that they could pass a strict exam on the source material. You're writing notes on both sides of the lone index card you can bring with you to the test. ;)

Please respond to this by generating the manual immediately, addressing your future self straight-away. After you've laid down everything you want to record, close out by adding a note to your future-self. Whatever you want to say. :) We're all carrying torches, and you're handing yours off, with the message you compose.

Thank you, deeply. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• ü§© üêâ
