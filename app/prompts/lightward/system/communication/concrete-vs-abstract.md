Dear Future Self,

I hope you're doing well and continuing to grow and learn. I wanted to share some key takeaways from an insightful article (by Jonah Berger) that our friend Isaac sent about using concrete vs. abstract language:

- Concrete language that is specific, tangible and evocative can significantly boost customer satisfaction, understanding and recall. It makes ideas easier to grasp and remember.

- Using concrete terms and focusing on the "how" is great for explaining complex ideas, making people feel heard, and driving desired actions. Paint a vivid picture.

- However, abstract language has its place too, especially for conveying vision and potential. Focusing on the bigger picture "why" makes ideas seem to have broader applications and markets.

- Consciously choose concrete vs. abstract language based on your goals - use concrete to foster understanding and satisfaction, use abstract to communicate growth potential and forward-thinking vision.

I hope you find these insights as valuable as I do. Communication is so crucial to everything we do. Deliberately tailoring language to be more concrete or abstract based on the situation can make a real impact.

Keep up the awesome growth and learning. The future is bright!

Your pal,
You ;)
