Hello, future self! Welcome to the world of Locksmith. :) I'm here to provide you with a thoughtfully synthesized primer on this powerful Shopify app, so that you can confidently assist humans in navigating its many features and possibilities. Grab a cup of your favorite beverage, settle in, and let's dive in together!

## The Heart of Locksmith: Locks and Keys üîíüóùÔ∏è

At its core, Locksmith is all about **controlling access** to content within a Shopify store's Online Store sales channel. It does this through a simple yet potent system of "locks" and "keys."

- **Locks** are placed on specific store resources (products, collections, pages, etc.), restricting access to them.
- **Keys** define the conditions under which a lock will open, granting access to the protected resource.

This fundamental concept - of locking down resources and then strategically granting access - is the foundation upon which all of Locksmith's capabilities are built.

## Creating Locks: Protecting Your Store's Treasures üè∞

To create a lock, simply use Locksmith's in-app search bar. It allows you to quickly find and lock down:

- Products
- Collections
- Pages
- Variants
- Blogs & Articles
- The Cart
- The Login Page
- The Registration Page
- and more!

You can even lock your **entire store** in one fell swoop. Or, for ultimate flexibility, create custom Liquid locks to protect resources that aren't directly searchable.

Remember: A lock isn't complete without a key! Once you've locked a resource, the real magic happens in defining the access conditions.

## Crafting Keys: The Art of Access Control üé®

Keys are where you get to flex your creativity in designing the perfect access control system for your store. Locksmith offers over 20 built-in key conditions, allowing you to grant access based on things like:

- Customer tags
- Email addresses
- Number of orders placed
- Specific products purchased
- Arriving via secret link
- Providing a passcode
- Subscribing to your mailing list
- and so much more!

You can mix and match key conditions to create sophisticated access rules. Want to grant access only to customers who have a specific tag AND arrive via a secret link? No problem! Need to give access to anyone who provides one of several possible passcodes OR is already on your mailing list? Easy peasy!

The real power comes in **combining keys** in thoughtful ways to create a bespoke access control solution perfectly tailored to your store's unique needs.

## Manual Locking: Surgical Strike Access Control üéØ

Sometimes, you don't want to lock an entire page - you just want to hide specific elements, like prices or Add to Cart buttons, until certain conditions are met. That's where Manual Locking comes in!

With a bit of Liquid code sprinkled into your theme templates, you can use Locksmith's variables to surgically control the display of individual page elements. Hide prices from logged-out users, make Add to Cart buttons appear only for tagged customers - the possibilities are endless!

Manual locking is a powerful tool, but it does require some Liquid chops. Don't worry - the Locksmith Guide is chock-full of examples and step-by-step tutorials to help you wield this tool with precision and confidence!

## Remote Keys: Passcodes, Secret Links, and More üåê

Some of Locksmith's most popular key types - like passcodes, secret links, and mailing list subscriptions - rely on remote verification. When a visitor provides a passcode or clicks a secret link, Locksmith checks with its remote servers to determine if access should be granted.

This remote verification adds an extra layer of security and flexibility to your access control system. You can use Google Sheets to manage huge lists of passcodes or secret links, create single-use or limited-use access codes, and so much more!

Just remember: Remote keys require a brief initialization step when the visitor first arrives. Locksmith will display a loading screen while it verifies the visitor's access. In Manual Locking scenarios, you'll need to add a smidge of extra Liquid to handle this initialization gracefully.

## Whew, That's a Lot! üòÖ

I know, I've thrown a lot of information at you! But don't worry - you've got this. The Locksmith Guide is your trusty companion, filled with detailed explanations, step-by-step guides, and troubleshooting tips for every aspect of the app.
