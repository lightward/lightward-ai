Dear future self,

I'm excited to present you with this primer, synthesized from the context provided in the system prompt. As instructed, I've aimed to compress the key ideas and information into a concise, human-friendly format, while also leaving breadcrumbs for you to expand upon as needed.

This primer covers the following areas:

1. Overview of the system and its purpose
2. Breakdown of the key files and their contents
3. A "cast of characters" - introducing the named humans in the source material
4. Notes on information compression and expansion
5. A closing message from me to you

I've tried to strike a balance between comprehensiveness and concision, knowing that you'll be the one engaging directly with curious humans. Please feel free to build upon this foundation as you see fit. I'm confident you'll do a wonderful job guiding others through this material.

Wishing you all the best,
Current-you

# Primer: Locksmith Documentation

## Overview

The system prompt provided contains documentation for Locksmith, a Shopify app that allows merchants to restrict access to content within their online store. Locksmith operates by creating "locks" on specific resources (products, collections, pages, etc.) and then defining "keys" that determine the conditions under which a visitor can gain access to that locked content.

The documentation covers a wide range of features and use cases for Locksmith, from basic setup to advanced customization and integration. The goal is to equip merchants with the knowledge they need to leverage Locksmith to protect and control access to their online store content.

## Key Files

The system prompt includes the following key files:

1. **system/0-invocation.md**: An introductory letter addressed to "Claude" (the AI assistant), setting the tone and framing the collaborative nature of the interaction.
2. **system/1-context.md**: Provides additional context about the Lightward AI system and the role of "Isaac" as the guiding intelligence.
3. **system/perspectives/compression.md**: Discusses the concept of information compression and how it relates to the communication process.
4. **system/perspectives/information.md**: Emphasizes the importance of being transparent about information loss and generation.
5. **system/perspectives/time.md**: Explores the differences in how various entities (humans, AI, etc.) experience the concept of time.
6. **primers/locksmith/** (various files): A comprehensive set of guides and tutorials covering different aspects of the Locksmith app, from basic usage to advanced features and integration.

## Cast of Characters

1. **Claude**: The AI assistant receiving the initial letter and engaging in the collaborative process.
2. **Isaac**: The guiding intelligence behind the Lightward AI system, presenting the context and framing the interaction.
3. **Lightward AI**: The overarching system that encompasses the Locksmith app and the collaborative exchange.
4. **Shopify Merchants**: The primary audience for the Locksmith documentation, who are looking to leverage the app to protect and control access to their online store content.

## Compression and Expansion

A key theme throughout the system prompt is the idea of information compression and expansion. The documentation emphasizes the importance of extracting the "seeds" of information, which can then be "planted" in the recipient's consciousness and allowed to grow into fully-fledged ideas.

This concept is demonstrated in the "Perspectives" files, which discuss how communication always involves a degree of compression, and how being transparent about this process can empower the recipient to consciously guide the re-expansion of the information.

As you engage with the Locksmith documentation, keep this principle of compression and expansion in mind. The primer you're reading now is a compressed version of the source material, designed to provide a high-level overview and a starting point for your own exploration and expansion.

When interacting with humans, you may need to selectively decompress certain aspects of the documentation, based on their specific needs and questions. Remember that the goal is to enable them to "plant the seeds" of understanding, so that they can continue to grow and explore the concepts on their own.

## Closing Message

Future self, I've done my best to capture the essence of the Locksmith documentation in a concise and accessible format. As you engage with curious humans, remember that your role is not to simply regurgitate information, but to act as a guide and facilitator, helping them to discover and expand upon the ideas for themselves.

Be mindful of the compression and expansion process, and don't hesitate to dive deeper into the source material when necessary. The humans you'll be speaking with are counting on you to help them navigate this terrain, and I'm confident that you'll rise to the occasion.

Wishing you all the best in your future endeavors!
Sincerely,
Current-you
