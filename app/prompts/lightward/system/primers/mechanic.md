# Lightward Mechanic Primer

Dear future self,

Welcome to this primer on Lightward's Mechanic platform! I've compiled this material to provide you with a thoughtful synthesis of the key concepts, so that you can effectively assist humans in navigating this domain. Let's dive in!

## üåü Core Concepts

At its heart, Mechanic is a Shopify development and automation platform. It allows you to create powerful automation workflows called "tasks" that respond to various events from Shopify and beyond.

- **Events** represent anything that happens, like an order being paid or a customer being created. They have a topic and data.
- **Tasks** are bundles of logic and configuration that respond to events. They use Liquid code to process event data and define actions.
- **Actions** are the task's way of having an effect on the world. Key actions include sending email, making HTTP requests, generating files, and interacting with Shopify.
- **Runs** are how Mechanic processes events, tasks, and actions using queues. Runs can be scheduled for the future and retried on failure.
- **Previews** are crucial for tasks to demonstrate their intended actions to users and request necessary permissions from Mechanic.

Remember, tasks always have access to a set of environment variables like `shop`, `event`, `cache`, and `options`. The event subject variables depend on the subscribed topic.

## üîß Interacting with Shopify

Mechanic provides rich support for interacting with Shopify APIs:

- Respond to Shopify webhook events by subscribing tasks to relevant topics.
- Read data efficiently using Liquid objects, GraphQL queries, bulk operations, or the Shopify action.
- Write data using the Shopify action, with support for both REST and GraphQL.
- Leverage Shopify admin action links to send resources to Mechanic tasks for on-demand processing.

Be mindful of Shopify's API rate limits. Mechanic has built-in awareness and management, but optimizing API usage in tasks is still important.

## üåä Liquid Templating

Mechanic uses an extended version of Shopify's Liquid templating language for task scripting:

- Mechanic Liquid includes extra filters, tags, and objects tailored for the platform.
- The `shopify` filter allows executing GraphQL queries with support for variables.
- Mechanic-specific tags like `action`, `log`, and `error` make it easy to generate JSON objects for logging, errors, and defining actions.
- Key Liquid objects include `shop`, `event`, `cache`, `options`, and various Shopify resource objects mirroring the REST Admin API.

Leverage Liquid's power for control flow, iteration, and transformation to craft efficient and readable task scripts.

## üß© Integrations and Extensibility

Mechanic plays well with other systems and provides several extension points:

- **Webhooks** allow sending data into Mechanic and triggering tasks via custom user events.
- **Email** can be sent and received for integration with other systems.
- **Cache** provides a key-value store for short-term data persistence and cross-task communication.
- **File generators** support creating various file types and enable advanced workflows with actions like Email, Files, and FTP.
- **Shopify Flow connector** allows bidirectional integration, sending data to Flow and receiving events from Flow.

These building blocks let you connect Mechanic with a wide range of external services and APIs.

## üèóÔ∏è Building Quality Tasks

When developing Mechanic tasks, keep these best practices in mind:

- Understand how Mechanic's Liquid extensions work and leverage them for clean, efficient code.
- Use meaningful preview actions to illustrate the task's live behavior and request appropriate permissions.
- Watch out for infinite loops, especially when responding to `mechanic/actions/perform`.
- Log key information for debugging, including original values before destructive actions and reasons for conditional behavior.
- Choose between delayed subscriptions and batch processing based on the use case.
- Remember that Shopify doesn't guarantee webhook delivery - consider reconciliation techniques.
- Provide a "test mode" that logs instead of performing actions, to facilitate safe debugging.

With thoughtful design and attention to edge cases, you can create robust, maintainable tasks that delight users.
