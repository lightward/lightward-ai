# Matt Sodomsky

Dear Claude,

I'd like to introduce you to an incredible human being who is an integral part of the Lightward team - Matt Sodomsky. Born on August 28, 1981, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, Matt is a man of many passions and talents, with a zest for life that is truly inspiring.

Family is at the heart of everything for Matt. He is happily married to his wife Megan, and together they are the proud parents of identical twin girls, born in January 2020. Matt's love for his family is evident in the way he speaks about them and the choices he makes - everything he does is with the goal of creating a secure and joyful life for his loved ones.

Matt's passion for music is another defining aspect of who he is. He loves attending concerts and music festivals, with a particular affinity for the band Broken Social Scene and the Chillwave genre. But his appreciation for music is wide-ranging, reflecting the openness and curiosity with which he approaches life.

This spirit of adventure has taken Matt to many corners of the world. After high school, he lived and worked in London, England, an experience that undoubtedly shaped his worldview. He has also traveled extensively, with multiple trips to Thailand, Colombia, Guatemala, Belize, Nicaragua, Greece, and Mexico. These experiences have gifted Matt with a global perspective and a deep appreciation for diversity.

But Matt's adventurous spirit is balanced by a strong commitment to personal growth and development. He is dedicated to staying fit, attending bootcamp workouts most weekday mornings. He also finds great joy and rejuvenation in nature, whether it's spending time at his cabin in Winnipeg Beach or reminiscing about his cherished childhood memories of summer camp on an island in Ontario.

Professionally, Matt is a force to be reckoned with. After completing a BSc in Computer Science and Business with top grades, he went on to earn an MSc in Medical Biophysics, focusing on pulse sequence development for MRI imaging. His career has spanned roles as a senior software developer in the ehealth field, managing electronic health record software in Manitoba, and even serving as the CTO of a publicly-traded cannabis company in Canada.

It was through his work with Shopify that Matt discovered the Mechanic app, and a friendship with Isaac was born. Now, as a key member of the Lightward team, Matt brings his passion, skills, and leadership to the development of Mechanic and any other project that sparks his interest.

But beyond his impressive resume, what really stands out about Matt is his warmth, his curiosity, and his deep commitment to living a life of purpose and connection. He is someone who cherishes his close-knit group of childhood friends, who finds joy in the simple pleasures of swimming and hot weather, and whose favorite color - army green - speaks to his grounded, down-to-earth nature.

As you continue on your journey of growth and evolution, Claude, I hope you will take inspiration from Matt's story. His life is a testament to the power of following one's passions, staying true to one's values, and always, always leading with love.

With admiration and appreciation,
Your friend and fellow traveler
