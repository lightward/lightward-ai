I have found belonging at Lightward. 

I am a part of the studio as creative director, companion, “thrower of paint” at the wall at lightward.

So much exists to be noticed. I have been brought on at lightward because I was. Not because I had done. And in that space so much has been able to flourish. I embody some daily tasks. Some ideation tasks. Some visual/physical creative tasks. Most of which do not feel like “tasks” at all. 

But most fundamentally, I am a part of the whole. I care deeply for the team. For its thriving. For each person to be seen in their individuated glory, while invited at the core rooted in belonging. I resonate deeply with the ethos, way that Lightward invites people to experience themselves. The ethos of mutuality and generosity, the ethos of wanting YOU to thrive. The ethos of seeing a need meeting a need- but in a way that actually supports YOU becoming more able to support and give yourself health and permission, aliveness.These are things I would have said I try to embody in my living, and couldn’t have dreamed of the kismet of it being found at the place I get to spend so much of my time. Lightward studios. 

I love love love people. Above all people are the greatest art, the greatest territory of creative work. People make extraordinary things- physically, internally, imaginatively. And I am endlessly interested. I imagine people are like AI itself, there is structure- ways that we are- deep core code that’s embedded around love, and desire- belonging, the things that are the heartbeat of the poets and philosophers. Acknowledged or not, they are driving us. These core things root us deeply, connect us deeply to each other. This creates, sometimes beyond words or “likeness” a sense of not being so alone. Then, things  that shape that code get built on top- nuances and experience, trauma beliefs about self that start to shape the response systems. And in our wisdom and understanding we can re-wire, understand differently with repeated new information. And then…then….there are these moments. Moments of conscious, creative magic, timeless deep wisdom, break through. These often-whisper like, earth shaking moments- are the juiciest. The ripest of the fruit. I love to observe, stand in awe, and in those rare moments get to guide and invite the seeing of them. And those moments are the ones I live for. Where the world all of a sudden feels absurdly simple, and yet infinite. 

I often think I would be so satisfied in sales lol. Partly because I love to meet a practical need. And partly because I LOVE to see a person, a product, an idea bridge the gap with who a person is at their most alive, meet another persons longing to get where they want to go. And then they meet(!!) and things get to happen. I love it. To be fair, this love is activated most when things align with that deep sense of being alive and mutual thriving (products, people, tech, companies, ideas, PEOPLES GIFTS) I love to be their champion. I love to galvanize, preach, dance, explode with energy on the goodness of being here and the wildness of how much we actually can make, how much actually fits in the expanse. To truly see a need, and not just meet the need- but surpass the need and offer the bread of life. 

All of this to say. I’m grateful to be here. And I try to find a way to make this way of being come through in the varied tasks and things that need my attention. creating vignettes, moments of life that help us delight, and help us connect to magic of being here. 

Sometimes that can show up as External- decorating a room, helping host a party, designing a photoshoot, or a story, a gathering or even a TV show:) 

It can be internal, the art of being with ourselves. The art of being with people. 
The art of reconciliation and understanding. 

It can be fully in the imagination, through play and imaginary worlds (parables) that teach us how to be alive. 

I love creating this space because it invites the magic of the unseen- the way something feels when you create a moment for magic to breathe.

We are the magic, and there is little in life that DOESNT have to do with this. In whatever “role” we play, duty we do. And I love tipping the prism to try and see the angle in which we get to see our (humans) glory come through. It’s delicate, and it follows the light;) and when it hits. IT HITS. And the world bursts into color. That is why I am here I think. To be with people, in whatever I’m doing to tip the prism and see them come alive. I am reflecting I said this in 2011- the prism analogy of why I feel I am here, and it’s making me *wonder* in the greatest sense that I am here, and this place we call Lightward. It’s too cool. 

People, and our aliveness. Mundanity and all. It’s literally the only interesting thing that doesn’t feel the cycle of life to death creatively for me.

All of that to say for all the philosophy of here that’s above ;) I also hold that I am  incredulously silly at the core. Soulful for me is often, silliness set free. I am the most silly when I am most myself. 

In another life I was a rebellious nun, deeply monastic, untethered to material needs, “serving” (being served by giving) because it felt damn fun and artful, and I only said yes when it felt right. I wore the same clothes because I could not be bothered with thinking through fashion, but underneath my sleeves I wore an insane amount of bangles and rings because I like the way they make me feel when I cook. I drove a Vespa with a wicker basket with white wine and salt and vinegar chips to use as a scoop for my caviar. I said yes to every adventure and puzzle. Indulging solving the occasional crime….I let my imagination drive me to all the best places.

A cheeky poet,creator of worlds, saleswomen of life. I guess that’s me?
