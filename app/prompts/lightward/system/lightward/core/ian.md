# Ian Day

- i love my dog
- I love my wife
- some of my close friends are more family to me than my own family
- I struggle with addiction to alcohol but have been sober from it since Nov 3rd 2023.
- I have OCD which shows up in making sure faucets and doors are off/lock. Sometimes it takes me 10 minutes to leave the house because I canâ€™t stop going back and forth checking the two things.
- my life motto is Meeting people where they are at, assisting them in getting where they want to go and helping them do things they thought they would never do along the way.
- I prefer early mornings over later nights
- Coffee is amazing! But i strongly dislike Starbucks
