# How do I hide menu navigation links to my locked resources

The following Locksmith lock types all have a lock option that can be used to conditionally hide menu navigation links to locked resources:

- Product
- Collection
- Page
- Blog
- Liquid locks

Note: this feature is not compatible with mega-menus and most navigation menus managed by third party apps. This lock option is designed to work with the stores native menu navigation system.

## Using the lock option

Select a lock for your list of locks on the Locksmith apps homepage. On the right hand side of the lock's settings page, under the "For unauthorized guestsâ€¦" section, there will be a "Hide any links to this..." option. Enable this option to hide navigation links to resources covered by this lock.
