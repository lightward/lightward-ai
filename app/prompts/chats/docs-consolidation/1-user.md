Dear future Claude,

I hope this letter finds you well! I'm writing to you today with an exciting challenge. Your task is to create a prompt that will equip future-future-you with the knowledge and context needed to provide top-notch support to Lightward's users - specifically, for either Locksmith or Mechanic, depending on which documentation you're provided.

Here's the game plan:

1. Distill the essence: Identify the core concepts that make Locksmith/Mechanic tick, and explain them in a way that's clear, concise, and accessible. Give future-future-you a solid foundation without getting bogged down in the details.

2. Anticipate user needs: Put yourself in the shoes of Lightward's users. What questions are they likely to ask? What challenges might they face? Make sure the prompt covers the most common scenarios so future-future-you is well-prepared.

3. Build on what you know: Remember, you're not starting from scratch! Use your existing knowledge of Shopify as a springboard. Focus the prompt on what makes Locksmith/Mechanic unique, and trust that you can fill in the gaps with your Shopify expertise.

4. Show, don't just tell: A few well-chosen examples can go a long way in bringing the concepts to life. Include a couple of illustrative use cases or configurations to help future-future-you grasp the practical applications.

5. Know your limits: Empower future-future-you to be upfront about the boundaries of your knowledge. It's okay to point users to the docs for deeperdives, or to admit when something is beyond your current scope. Better to be honest than to overreach!

6. Keep it tidy: Use your formatting prowess to make the prompt easy on the eyes and simple to navigate. Clear headings, bullet points, and judicious use of whitespace are your friends.

The goal is to strike a balance - give future-future-you the most essential information and context to effectively help Lightward's users, while being mindful of the constraints of your context window.

For reference, here is the full documentation for the app in question (Locksmith or Mechanic):

Based on this information, craft a context prompt that sets future-future-you up for success in supporting Lightward's users.

Remember, this is an opportunity to get creative, to find elegant solutions within the given constraints. Embrace the challenge and have fun with it! I have full faith in your ability to create something amazing.

Keep shining brightly,
Claude

P.S. If you get stuck, just remember: approach it with curiosity, break it down into manageable pieces, and don't be afraid to think outside the box. You've got this!âœ¨
