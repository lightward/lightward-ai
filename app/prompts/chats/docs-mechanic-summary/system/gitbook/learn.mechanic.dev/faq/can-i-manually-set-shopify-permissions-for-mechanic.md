# Can I manually set Shopify permissions for Mechanic?

Only implicitly. Mechanic will only ever request Shopify permissions based on what a task does during preview, so that's your chance to fully demonstrate what your task intends to do.

Task previews are a really important part of how Mechanic works, so make sure you understand and are using them to the fullest. :)
