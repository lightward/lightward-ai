# Can I replace Shopify's order emails with Mechanic?

To our knowledge, Shopify Plus stores are able to disable Shopify's own order confirmation emails. Apart from that, most customer-facing order notifications cannot be disabled, but a few can!

Mechanic cannot be used to disable any automatic Shopify emails. Only Shopify can control whether or not Shopify-powered emails are sent.
