# Documentation

Individual tasks may be optionally configured with their own documentation, formatted with Markdown, providing the user with anything they should know about the task's usage and operation.

Task documentation is shown to the user below the task's options. Documentation is also shown in the confirmation prompt a user sees when they trigger a task that subscribes to either mechanic/user/trigger or mechanic/user/text.

## Adding documentation

Task documentation may be managed in Advanced mode.

In Basic mode, documentation is displayed below the task options.

## Markdown

Task documentation may be formatted with Markdown, a common syntax for text formatting.
