# The Shopify action

The Shopify action allows developers to submit any request to the Shopify Admin API. By responding to action results, the data returned by Shopify can be retrieved, and re-used by the calling task.

This approach should (probably) only be used as a last resort, when Mechanic's other methods of reading data do not cover the scenario.
