# Can I add another store to my existing Mechanic subscription?

Every customer-facing Shopify store needs its own Mechanic subscription.

Our Pay What Feels Good pricing policy has a useful side-effect in cases like this: it means you can think about all of your Shopify stores together, when feeling out a total price for Mechanic that feels good to you.

To talk about adjusting new and existing Mechanic subscriptions for your stores, write in with all the details to team@usemechanic.com.

Development stores, or other stores that will never see customer traffic, usually qualify for a super-extended free trial.
