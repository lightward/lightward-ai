# Can Mechanic read or manage customer subscriptions?

No. Shopify does have well-developed APIs for customer subscription contracts, but they don't currently allow one app to read or manage subscriptions created by another app. (Shopify does have a read\_all\_subscription\_contracts scope, but they haven't elected to approve this scope for any third-party apps just yet.)

If this affects your business, please let Shopify know! We'd love to have Mechanic be useful in this area too. :)

For community discussion on this subject, see this Slack thread. (If you haven't joined the community Slack workspace yet, join here first: slack.mechanic.dev.)
