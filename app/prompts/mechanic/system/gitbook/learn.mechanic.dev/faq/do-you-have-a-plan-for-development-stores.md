# Do you have a plan for development stores?

If you have a store that will never see customer traffic, then we can help out with this. :) Mechanic doesn't have separate plans, but we do grant super-extended trial periods for development stores. Write in to team@usemechanic.com, making sure to include your store name, and we'll help you out.

Learn more about our approach to this here: Platform / Policies / Plans / Development stores.

Did you know we have a Slack workspace you can join? It's true! This is the right place to ask implementation questions, and to compare notes with other problem-solvers. Come join us!
