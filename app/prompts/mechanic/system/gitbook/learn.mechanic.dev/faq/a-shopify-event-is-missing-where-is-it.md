# A Shopify event is missing. Where is it?

This FAQ is about Shopify events specifically. For a more general treatment of this question, refer to Why don't I see any events in my task's activity?.

Start by checking status.mechanic.dev and shopifystatus.com for service interruptions. (If you're not signed up for Mechanic status notifications, this is a good time to take care of that!)

If the event is well and truly missing, email team@usemechanic.com for further assistance.

⚠️ Please note: these investigations usually conclude that Shopify has simply failed to deliver that specific event webhook. Shopify does not offer a strict guarantee on webhook delivery (see their documentation), which means that the solution is usually to ensure tasks can recover when events go missing.

To learn more about this, see Reconciling missing events.
