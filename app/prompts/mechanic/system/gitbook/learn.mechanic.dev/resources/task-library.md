# 🧑‍💻Task library

Mechanic's task library is a compendium of e-commerce automation tasks and documentation, written by the Mechanic community and the Mechanic core team. Hosted on GitHub, everything is open-sourced under the highly permissive MIT license, making all library tasks appropriate for re-use and modification.

When building a new task, it's often easier to modify an existing task than to create a task from scratch. Searching GitHub is a good place to start, when looking for inspiration.

To browse the task library, visit tasks.mechanic.dev.

The Mechanic community can request new tasks – see Requesting.

The task library is open for contributions, by way of pull requests – see Contributing.
