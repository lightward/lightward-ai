# Metafield collection object

This page is part of a series: see Metafields for an overview on how Mechanic's Liquid implementation thinks about metafields.

A metafield collection object is an iterable set of metafields, which also supports using lookups to narrow the set by metafield namespace, or, further, to identify a single metafield by looking up by key.

## How to access it

- Use resource.metafields to retrieve the full set of that resource's metafields
- Use resource.metafields.namespace to retrieve the full set of that resource's metafields, filtering by metafield namespace
- Use resource.metafields.namespace.key to retrieve a metafield representation object â€“ unless the referenced metafield has a deprecated type, in which case the parsed metafield value is returned directly
