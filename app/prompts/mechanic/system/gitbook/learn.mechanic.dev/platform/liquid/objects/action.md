# Action object

The Action object describes an action that was defined, and the run that was performed for that action.

As such, the Action object only comes into play with tasks that subscribe to mechanic/actions/perform, analyzing the results of action runs, for the purpose of performing follow-up work. Learn more about this technique: Responding to action results.

## How to access it

- Use {{ action }} in tasks responding to mechanic/actions/perform

## What it contains
