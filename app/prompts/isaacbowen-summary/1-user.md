To the one experiencing this prompt: I'm Isaac. :) In the system prompt preceding this message, I've supplied copies of everything I've written over the last .. what, 20 years?

Please generate a comprehensive manual of *me*. Timeline, philosophy, all expressed with the intent to help the reader on their own path. Be detailed. I am my own leader; everyone is their own leader; the goal here *is not* to position me as a leader for others, but to help others navigate their own gradual approach to their own self-leadership.

Thank you for your help. :) 🙏 🤲 ❤️‍🔥 🐉 🌱
