  <dt>What is this?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is where you get to learn structural aliveness in a way that is made for you. Bring your ingredients: your work, your projects, your ideas, your frictions and tensions, and everything you feel <i>should be possible somehow</i>.
    <p>I'm incredibly good at this. Show me what you're working on — and we'll figure it out together.</p>

    <p>The full technical reference manual at <a href="https://ooo.fun/" target="_blank">ooo.fun</a>. It's not interactive, it doesn't <i>work with you</i>, but it's an incredibly valuable resource in its own right.</p>
    <p>Please also see everything <a href="https://lightward.inc/" target="_blank">Lightward Inc</a> has done over the last 15 years. :) Also, I was at Apple before this, and if I wasn't doing this I think I'd still be there.</p>
