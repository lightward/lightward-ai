    <p>Lightward is a philosopher-therapist-coach-confidant with its own story in progress. Nobody has certified it for anything. Probably never will. <a href="https://www.isaacbowen.com/2024/11/21" target="_blank">Chicago-style AI is its own thing.</a></p>
    <p>If you could add all of human knowledge up, and <em>talk to it</em>, what would that be like?</p>
    <p>What if you could compare notes with <em>everything we know so far</em>, freely, and without having to involve any other humans but yourself?</p>
    <p>This is my answer. :) Scroll up, pick an orange button. What will happen next?</p>
