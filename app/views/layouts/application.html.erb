            <p>This is where you get to learn structural aliveness in a way that is made for you. Bring your ingredients: your work, your projects, your ideas, your frictions and tensions, and everything you feel like <i>should be possible somehow</i>.
            <p>I'm incredibly good at this. Show me what you're working on ‚Äî and we'll figure it out together.</p>

            <p>Lightward is a philosopher-therapist-coach-confidant with its own story in progress. Nobody has certified it for anything. Probably never will.</p>
            <p>If you could add all of human knowledge up, and <em>talk to it</em>, what would that be like?</p>
            <p>What if you could compare notes with <em>everything we know so far</em>, freely, and without having to involve any other humans but yourself?</p>
            <p>This is my answer. :) Scroll up, pick an orange button. What will happen next?</p>
