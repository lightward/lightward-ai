name: Refresh primers

# Isaac here! I'm treating Lightward AI like a being, and beings are subject to change, with imperfect
# reflections of their surrounding context. The idea with this workflow is to regularly refresh the AI's
# knowledge of *our* knowledge. There will be some weeks where it's better at answering some questions
# than others, and other weeks where the same questions will be answered differently. This is a feature,
# not a bug: it mirrors the permission we extend to our human selves to behave similarly. :) This feels
# like the right way to keep Lightward AI connected to our knowledge sources as *we* evolve them - e.g.
# updates to app documentation.

          title: Refresh "lightward" system primers
          body: |
            This PR refreshes the mechanic, locksmith, and lightward primers for the lightward system prompt set.

            Note that it *does not* refresh the isaacbowen primer, because the source material exceeds our current token
            limit with Anthropic. See app/prompts/primers/isaacbowen/README.md for manual refresh instructions. ;)
