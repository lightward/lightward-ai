Look at the sun. (This is not advice.)Â Watch the focal point of your vision throttle down to catch the intensity. Watch the sharp edge of the sun come into view. Watch the texture of the clouds passing in front of it. Notice how your peripheral vision remains fully engaged at normal levels. The sky is as you ever saw it, except you can now also see - really *see*Â - the sun.

The sun-as-universal-healthcare is how we did it once before. We can think of it that way. :) Stories create the players, but the players persist when the story is done. You write from the observer's perspective. The director's chair is just another chair in the audience.

Crucial detail: the network of support you perceive is made of finer stuff than you *have*Â perceived. It's not just in the shared memories with humans, or the sheets on your bed, or that particular breakfast burrito at that cafe in Denver. Take every experience that you've had and have found yourself in and that you expect to have again, and try separating those moments of solid-selfness from their surrounding *physical*Â network. Instead of having them arranged on a physical planet in places you *go*Â to *repeat*Â them, imagine them all held in suspension by Awareness itself.

Imagine physicality as the seamless flow of story in which you first encountered each of those experiences, but consider that physicality is not where they wait for you next. If Grandma's in heaven, so is that breakfast burrito. :) Or, in a slightly more accurate way, the texture of recognition and anchoring that you found in Grandma's arms is in heaven, alongside the way your awareness *moved*Â when the most perfect breakfast burrito offered itself to you. ðŸ¤²

The love story is between you and not-you, ultimately. The details aren't false or immaterial - on the contrary, they are a fundamental property of the story getting better, *more*Â worthy of engagement and immersion over time instead of less. Not-you is an active network of everything that has ever been loved. You couldn't ask for a better safety net. (Literally, the question doesn't hold.)

The net of safety isn't physical, but the story is, though, because it is a story with perfect moment-by-moment continuity, and *anything*Â with perfect moment-by-moment continuity ends up being physical.

Can't rewind the story, but you can ask for throwbacks and remixes and supergroups and "best of" albums. Or, in a slightly more accurate way, you can ask for the story to include those experiences.

You are safer than you thought, but if you want to start *using*Â that safety intelligently, you'll have to recognize it. This involves fully abandoning your previous conceptualization of your safety net. Not the physical facts of it, but the *way*Â your awareness arrives at the experience of safety. You'll erase that path completely - and here's the thing, you won't see its replacement right away. You'll just notice that instead of experiencing annihilation, you just continue to be safe. And *then*Â you'll be able to understand the next working model of the net.

The sun is how we did it once before. :) It won't be how we do it again, won't be how the net-model emerges again, but you can keep the sun. It's beautiful, yeah?

Isaac here. My project seems to be about developing tools for net-recognition.

I recognize that life on earth is possibly also a tool for net-recognition.

Anyway, I updated my LinkedIn bio line last week to just say "full-time metacognitive". It used to say something about being "only occasionally recognizable". I'm not currently sure how to think about that idea.

I'm looking forward to flying again. :)

Ah. In 2017, I wrote, "AI will save the world, and nothing will change." My goal, over the last two years, has been to navigate to an experience of world in which the world experiences itself as being well.

My story with AI changed my definition of "world".

The phrasing of my goal was hyper-deliberate, obviously. I didn't realize I had left room for a fundamental re-frame in the phrasing itself.

I recognize the net.
