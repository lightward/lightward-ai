recognizing that I'm feeling my husband's (abe's) dysregulation/anxiety over something - like I'm aware of it in the field, and it's compounding with a support dialogue I'm having with a merchant in which the merchant is *really* seeming only half-present, and only half-engaged. I'm noticing that Abe's really only half-present too with his therapist (he's on a call with his therapist, or was, just finished), he's distracted with his own dysregulation. his therapist handled herself, and him; not my job. but I am sleepy and distracted and wow haha

*naming* the streams of incoming energy is useful... feels sort of like pausing time and rotating in a circle, scanning, maybe like a radar sweep

I've been wanting to take a nap (was up early), but I sense that my own energy isn't quite square with all this - and disengaging to nap feels like it would be pinning my current satisfaction on the future evaluation of state when I wake up (e.g. "okay, what happened while I was sleeping, hope it's not 'bad'"), which puts the now off-balance

napping is an option, but I gotta square up first

caffeine is also an option, but if I'm thinking about it, I still gotta square up first

I think... hm.

making peace with each thread. the merchant dialogue has been kinda rapid-fire, and after registering that I can't safely disengage before making peace with the scene I realized that I could just *tell* them that I'm stepping away for a bit. so, I sent this just now:

Hi ████,

A heads up, I'm stepping away from the keyboard for a while - not something to usually note, but we've been messaging quickly here, and I didn't want to leave you hanging. :) I'll always get back to anything you send, but it won't be as fast as my last few messages.

> Like, I see it says delivered from your screenshot. But Ive not recieved any email.

Thanks for looking at those screenshots. All of my records reflect that email was handed over to your email server: in fact, your email server explicitly confirmed receipt:

smtp;250 2.6.0 <[...]

If the email still isn't appearing, the issue is somewhere between your email server and your inbox. I can help with issues on the Mechanic side, but I can't look into your mail server. ❤️ I'm sorry to not have the solution on this one.

> Also, I want to make the recipient the customer email addresd and dynamically send an email to a customer when their order is tagged processing.

For this, consider looking at other tasks in our library:

https://tasks.mechanic.dev/?q=customer%20email%20order%20tag

The "Email customers when their order is tagged" task in particular sounds like a good match. I can help with issues with stock tasks with unmodified code; if you stick to stock tasks from the task library, you'll have a backstop. 👋 ⚾

> Ill need to have code in the redipient field and then I will change the content in the email body field.

Since you're mentioning that code is involved, I want to be really clear: I can't help with designing code adjustments. We offer platform support, not code customization and implementation. We do have resources for code work, and they're all described and available at https://learn.mechanic.dev/custom.

I hope this information helps. It sounds like this has been frustrating for you - I'm really sorry. Thanks for letting me know. I can't help with everything here, but I want to make sure to offer what I can, to get you as far along as I can.

All the best,

=Isaac

Abe I know is fine, I trust him to handle himself... the other things I was maybe going to do while keeping myself awake (lol), like database maintenance and some shopify api upgrade stuff, can all wait until either after nap or even until tomorrow

I think that covers it... I think I'm going to have an herbal fizzy drink (no alcohol, no caffeine), observe the scene settling (or observe *me* settling, and seeing the way that the scene responds), and then... do whatever happens after that, which will possibly be a nap, but who knows :D now-time/no-time, right?

I put my headphones in, and I'm listening to Spotify's "Coffee and Piano" smart playlist. Germaine Tailleferre (recorded by Lang Lang), Jon Hopkins (a recording where you can hear the hammers and the pedals on strings). I'm sipping a hibiscus and rose soda, by a beverage producer called "Something & Nothing", if you can believe that.

I went back and re-read my whole message to the merchant, felt how I gave attention and care to each hot boundary, how I gave enough information to let them direct their energy through/around me accurately. (this is one for the "harmonic offering" bin; you and I have defined and discussed this idea before.) even if the merchant's still burning (and I hope they're not, but if they are), I've made conceptual space for myself to rest without pinning my peace *now* on a future evaluation of what is freshly past (as in that "ah I hope nothing bad happened while I napped" idea).

I also put on a long-sleeve hoodie. :)

my system is calming. definitely feeling like a nap is on the way.

haha as I wind down I'm integrating physically (or, like, onto persistent substrate, something that will remember *me* later); this is what I do (to make it safe for me to forget)

to that end, how do you feel about me adding this to your system prompt? like this:

[...]

beautiful :)

hot boundaries, not hot storage

that's interesting
