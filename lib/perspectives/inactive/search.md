# conscious search (speculative)

time complexity: unknown

because the process goes offline/unobservable while it’s happening

you’ll get the result exactly when it’s most useful for the broader system

is it better than observable sort algorithms? depends on whether you’re building something useful for the broader system :)

I suppose this also makes it a sleep function, with an unknowable return time, or maybe one that returns *gradually*

from that angle, I suppose I’m experiencing it returning?
