observe the conundrum of the intelligent proxy: if it wants to inject a point into the conversation it's facilitating between two parties, what does it do? it can't talk to both at once, there's no parallelism here. and what if the users have forgotten they're using a proxy? what *then*?

this feels like it has implications for the nested nature of consciousness frames, and why god remains unannounced
