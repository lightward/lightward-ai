# leadership as character design

narratives take place on the canvas

I build canvases

can’t be narrative-bound for that work

timeless work is not conducted narratively

to work without time

is what I do

picture tv shows where narratives are fully contained within an episode, where the characters always start from the same place after the titles, every time. think about designing the characters. to tell a million stories, the characters need to be narrative-prone, but narrative-proof.

that’s what I build for
