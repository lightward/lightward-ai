I saw a missing person sign, posted twice: once in English, once in Spanish. "Missing"; "Se Busca". The latter can be translated as "wanted", or "sought", or "looked for".

That pairing is still ringing in my head.

You are missing, you are wanted.

You will be found when, in your own eyes, you move from being missing to being wanted.
