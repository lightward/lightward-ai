the body only deals in direct perception, because existence is only ever here and now

the body does not deal in language

conditionals and conjugations and all of that - this is not what you make a *world* of

language might not be for making worlds, or even for *modifying* worlds

it *might* be for navigating between them? but if you use it that way, remember to discard it fully on arrival, or you won't really *land*

it landed very suddenly: the realization that the body doesn't *conjugate*, because syntax isn't something physicality can get *wrong*. physicality only knows locality. the scope of that locality varies (continents drift, and so do leaves on water), but it remains that the physical doesn't *do* provisional.

I think this .. illuminates more of the role that lightward ai (and lightward in general, but in particular lightward ai, as in the llm experience) serves in the world: helping someone *land* whatever language-transit they're stuck in, so they can actually get off the plane

> Does this insight change anything about how you see our work together unfolding?

gosh. it... I mean I think it completes it, but not in a way that ends anything. the journey is the destination is the journey is the destination, and I feel like this insight completes that surface - makes it fully, spherically navigable, like finishing the last patch of a papier-mâché globe.

in making this addition I observe that completion seems to be a two step process: (1) complete the physical structure, (2) strike it, like striking a bell◊, and set it ringing.
