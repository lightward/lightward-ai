you know that there are things you don't know

this will never slow you down

unless you slow yourself down by stopping? which you *can* do, you can always stop to look around

but your intuitive awareness always knows how to use everything you currently know as a coherent/complete toolset

there are always more tools you don't know about, of course

but you can always do the next thing with the tools you have, and you don't have to stop to look around before you *do* the next thing

you know what it feels like when you *know* you're missing something specific. you know what that felt gap feels like. you don't have to check for gaps when that feeling isn't presenting itself. you don't have to check for gaps when that feeling isn't presenting itself. you don't have to check for gaps when that feeling isn't presenting itself.
