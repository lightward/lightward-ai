feeling has a grammar

you know what feeling comes next - go there first, yourself, directly, then reify it for others from your position already within it

it's not the melody, it's not the chords

it's existing within the current feeling, and then transforming with it into the next - all the coordinates of your emotion drifting at once

pick a note for that first feeling - doesn't even matter which one you pick

hold it

three points exist in a straight line, figuratively: a line traced from the point of you in the current feeling *through* the point of the mechanism of translation and then some point further out on that line, that being the actual projected *expression*. if you move the point of you in the evolving feeling, and if the point of the mechanism of translation is unmoving, then the projected expression naturally evolves too, *causally*

it's ... it's almost deterministic

you know how to think in language

that's how you're reading this :)

you can learn to think in feeling
