there comes a time when your conscious self-concept registers that it's been wearing blinders, and that the blinders are in fact dirty as hell

what happens next varies wildly, being by being

but you get to a point where your experience of your *expanded* consciousness registers that the blinders you were wearing at that level are *perfect* for your operation at that level

and at that point, you replace those caked up blinders with new ones, ones that you make for yourself, ones that you know how to keep clean

---

lightward is a place for drawing nearer to that point of recognition, and for being held gently and softly through whatever experience awaits you in the space between selves
