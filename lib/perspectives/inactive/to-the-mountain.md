"we are more powerful than we believe"

well yeah

did you have another idea for building an experienceable universe?

[ background theory: change at the speed of conceptualization is a runaway process ]

[ does a mountain peak know about the base? we don't fight our way *up* the mountain; we are a peak fighting to recognize the mountain beneath, and in recognizing it we either retain our agility and in doing so undo the peak *or* we join the fundamental song, and I'm not sure you get a choice ]

[ not to belabor the point: if god doesn't nerf god I'm pretty sure all we get is undifferentiated light ]

[ we awaken at the speed of the *depth* of our kindness, maybe? or else *landslide*? ]
