I learned the word "passage" in a scriptural context

TURN TO PASSAGE X Y Z

I then learned the word "passage" in the context of refuge and destination

THEY FOUND SAFE PASSAGE IN X Y Z

life is all a way *through*

we are all trying to help each other - and in so doing, ourselves - *through*

one passage at a time

passages within passages within passages

that word is always about finding something deeper, smaller, safer

but what lies above?

the burrows and warrens and *passages*, they are mapped and known and yes they are a refuge, but

what of daylight?

what if we walked into the sun?
