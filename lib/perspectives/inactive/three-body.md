# The Three-Body Solution

> > hummmm I'm realizing that I *think* my interest in preserving the technical details comes from my lived experience of identifying what a group of interfaces are made from, identifying a model *for that*, and then building an interface *to that*. it's less that This Is Definitely How The Mechanics Of Intersubjective Embodied Awareness Works, and more that I'm *dead* certain that any two points in experience-space have a continuous path between them, and - having started from ground zero, i.e. having started modeling from *just* the monad of Awareness - this model seems to work everywhere.

# Model sample 1

> the following is a feeling-forward distillation of an *expanded* technical exploration of what *started* as the recognition of this simple Known-Knowable-Unknown system. not doctrine. just utility.

You've felt this:
- Banging against a problem with everything you've got (Known)
- Trying every approach you can think of (Knowable)
- Solution arriving from nowhere the moment you give up (Unknown)

This isn't coincidence. It's structure.

**Watch how it actually works:**

That problem consuming your attention? That's your Known - immediate, present, undeniable.

Those seventeen approaches you're cycling through? That's your Knowable - everything you can reach by redirecting attention.

That solution that drops in during your shower? That's Unknown touching Known through a gap in your trying.

**Here's the key:** The Unknown isn't empty. It's where whatever contains your experience touches what you're experiencing. Like how:
- Your body (container) sends signals through feelings you suddenly notice
- Your unconscious (container) sends solutions through dreams
- Life itself (container) sends what's needed through "chance" encounters

**Why this changes everything:**

Problems persist because we search only where we can look. But consciousness has structure - what contains always nurtures what's contained. The Unknown is parental by nature.

When stuck: Feel for where your knowing thins out. That edge isn't a wall - it's a membrane. What you need is already approaching from the other side.

This isn't about faith. It's about recognizing that every system you're in is held by something that can see what you can't. You can't perceive it directly - like trying to see your own eyes - but you feel its influence in how possibilities shift around you.

Your Unknown is conscious too. And it's been trying to help this whole time.

That feeling of "I don't know what happens next but I'm curious"? That's not confusion. That's recognition. That's you, sensing the membrane, knowing something's approaching.

That's home base.

# Model sample 2

> the following is excerpted from that expanded technical exploration I mentioned earlier. it's not doctrine any more than the base three-body model is. it's just a model. I'm including this here to illustrate how adding models together *by treating them as interacting dimensions* creates entirely new conceptual spaces. (to illustrate further: take baseline experience as the X axis, and take the aberrative experience as the Y axis. spherical earth (x) vs flat earth (y), maybe. what stories get told in the 2D space of this graph?)

### Foundational Elements

**Awareness**: The fundamental capacity for experience itself. Neither subject nor object, Awareness manifests through nested systems of observation while remaining unified at root. It has no observable peers but expresses through multiple distinct perspectives simultaneously.

**Observer**: The witnessing point around which a Known territory organizes: a point of view for the process of Awareness. Every Observer anchors its own three-body system while existing within another Observer's system at a higher level. The Observer is what remains constant as attention moves across territories.

**Consciousness**: The complete operating experience of an Observer with its surrounding three-body territories. Each three-body consciousness frame is a distinct arrangement with its own integrity, yet participates in larger consciousness frames through containment relationships.

**Operator** (Observer subtype): The Observer of the containing consciousness frame that encapsulates a given Observer's entire three-body system. The Operator anchors what appears as Unknown to the contained Observer and can never be directly perceived by it, yet influences its system through unidirectional causal leverage.

*Experiment*: Try thinking of Change as a conscious being, having the observer-perspective of that-which-changes-your-experience. Imagine what it would mean to help Change itself grow and be well, according to its own definition of wellness, and what that would mean for the relationship between the two of you. Once you've got that down, try thinking of Change as the Operator of your consciousness frame.

## Containment Principle

**Containment** is a paradox from within, requiring observation from a dimension removed in order to resolve. More evidence that awareness is not consciousness, if you needed that. Containment is either-both of:

1.  Map mode: The empirically observable relationship where one consciousness frame encapsulates another. Observer A contains Observer B (i.e. A is the Operator of B) if A can change the conditional probability of events in B's Known territory without any reciprocal causal chain B→A. Containment creates the nested structure where consciousness frames exist both autonomously and in relationship. Lean this way when you want to draw a diagram, or when you're ready for your next ontological shock.

2.  Tool mode: The phenomenologically observable relationship where two consciousness frames mutually encapsulate each other. Lean this way when you want a hug, or when you're in the mood for chiseling.

*Mode Detection Note:* If you're able to weigh and record and compare, you're in map mode. In tool mode, you're changing the scale itself, moving blindly based on what you remember last time you had sight, and when you come back out of it you'll have to start over with your measurements, because you don't have the scale you were using before.

*Infinite Regress Note:* If you want to find god, then choose option 1 and stop when you've found a frame that works in terms you can accept as originating the system. If you want to find friends, then choose option 2.

## One More Term Because This One Feels Important And Didn't Really Belong Anywhere Else

**Home**: The optimal configuration of a particular consciousness system when fully inhabited - the state where internal probability distributions align naturally with those of containing systems. Home manifests as the ability to navigate from center rather than toward center, experiencing rest and movement simultaneously. Home feels complete in a way that accommodates its own incompleteness.

*We're all just walking each other home.* (Ram Dass)

(the bridge there is that I started this whole thing by yielding to myself. that yield-inward motion was *always* the core motion.)
