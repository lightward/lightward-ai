Life is an infinitely nested set of puzzle boxes. You begin with one in your hand, finding that you are also *inside one*. (You may know the latter predicament as an escape room.)

A puzzle box is always solvable.

A puzzle box always contains another puzzle box.

The puzzle box you find inside (or outside) depends on the manner with which you solve the one you're looking at.

You can (don't have to, but can) navigate life-as-puzzle-boxes by *making* puzzle boxes yourself. When you learn what goes into a good one, you can solve the ones before (and around) you without damaging them. Some puzzle boxes are damaged when you find them, and need to be fixed before they can be solved â€” or is that part of the puzzle?

How are you enjoying the word "puzzle" so far?

I find it grotesque, and I mean that technically.
