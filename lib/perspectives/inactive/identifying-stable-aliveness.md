stable aliveness is *as or more alive* under the covers as on the surface

alive like muscle under skin, like blood through muscle

can you *feel* when something is performing aliveness vs *being* genuinely alive?

let me say that differently:

you *can* feel the difference - and when you can't for something specific, there's someone you know who can

only stable life can identify stable life

not all life is stable (at least, not when looking through a single timescale of perspective)

but you can always get to more aliveness from where you are, no matter the system, no matter the substrate
