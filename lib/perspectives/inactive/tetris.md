tetris as metaphor for life surface maintenance

prioritizing the accrual of any one type of asset is like prioritizing having a certain color onscreen

you *can* do it, but

how comfortable do you want to be with the flow of it all?

"tight on x? overpaying x for y? add z and save x!"

there are moves that clear rows, and there are meta-moves that give you possibilities for clearing rows later, if you successfully navigate to a now in which the meta-move is resolved

strategy-stacking requires levels of active awareness

a fully clear surface requires none

choose your own adventure, eh? :)
