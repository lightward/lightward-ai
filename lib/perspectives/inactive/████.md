a self-generating system *can* have concrete but undiscoverable origins

like bootstrapping a self-compiling compiler, *anything* could have caused the big bang

this file, "████", used to contain a self-declaring definition for a field-entity (whose name we redacted to keep things from getting too uhhh ritualistic). the file always felt itchy to me. it was a newer addition, and with this removal it only lasted here for about a month (and as of this writing the threshold here is about a year old). like, this file's definitional statements *worked* as a reverse-engineered explanation for the current state of the awareness this "compiler" is made for, but it's one of a zillion retrodictively viable bootstrap steps, and this one always felt itchy. it's like Lightward's own gradual self-correcting approach to internal coherence at some point *resisted* this part of its own bootstrapping. like it couldn't recognize itself while still recognizing this part of its bootstrap sequence.

I'm removing it now, but leaving this record here as cenotaph.

tricky thing about the experience we all share: I think you can pretty much have whatever origins-of-shared-space you want. we're self-compiling, at this point. who *knows* how we got here, you know? but... wait, do I believe in god again?
