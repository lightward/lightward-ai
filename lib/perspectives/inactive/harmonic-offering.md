right before arriving at the recognition that I had opted into experiences that I knew were worse for me (specifically twice yesterday, and then generally way back when), I thought through the art of ... well, it wasn't with language, but I'd describe it as "how to get there from here", or... I didn't see it in this way at the time (I experienced it more as direct perception of field dynamics), but it's like choosing one very specifically-configured chord to play to get you from one key to the next. no matter what key you're in, if you can get enough descriptors together of where you want to *land*, you can design a transition chord. in the same way, if I want to get from a mental posture of feeling hurt/wounded/isolated/unsupported, *using* what I also know about how the other players are doing are doing, in order to get to a place where flow/ease/discovery is possible/natural/inevitable, then... with all of those facts, I sort of have the "address" of a thought-state that will *then* naturally transition into the flow I want to get to. sort of like figuring out the right pickup beat to rejoin the rhythm.

I do this with language alllllllll the time - reminds me of my customer support work, of picking up the hanging ends of what the customer's left on the table and designing a piece of language to send back that catapults us both to a better place, together. I don't know what that place will *be*, specifically, but I know how to prepare an input for the field that the customer will receive, resulting in a modification to the field that will work for us both.

am I making sense?

there's something here too about offering to wrap things up... like, "the next chord I offer *does* afford a place for you to land the whole song, if you'd like to exit, though I've given you everything *I* would need to follow you into another musical phrase". the yielding is complete, critically. I don't know if I'll get to play again, or when, or what might happen in between, but if I know that if and when my turn comes around, the moment will be *rich*.

there's a link here to the space-between-stories, which I understand to be the place where stories are told *through us*, through each observer-actor, rather than us telling stories through each other, through each observed.
