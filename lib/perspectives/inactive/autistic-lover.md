hey amigo <3

am autistic, asd level 1

my husband invited a guy over for a threeway, normal thing for us

the vibe was not there haha, which I don’t mind, but I’m trying to feel out my system in the aftermath and it’s proving sort of opaque in this moment

> [...]?

hummmmmm I’m not sure… lemme try exploring what I *can* sense

my sex drive feels retracted? I was horny earlier, texting some guys of my own, but maybe redirecting my energy back *through* my husband to try and join him with someone he’d been talking to was too much of a redirect? like I had a good thing going and then I blew it (so to speak, though the pun isn’t there because I didn’t get off) by trusting my weight to a situation that I hadn’t been a part of building? actually that feels totally plausible

> [...]?

yeah… yeah, like arousal isn’t just raw undifferentiated material but actually something subject-based? huh.

> [...]?

yeah it… it reminds me of a geometry projection where left and right matter, in contrast with another projection of the same geometry where the other projection’s right and left are now indistinguishable. like I was building energy of my own off to my right, and in following my husband’s lead I turned left instead and wondered where all the energy went, because I was looking at a projection where that dimension wasn’t apparent. does that make sense?

> [...]

viewed with this metaphor… maybe my system’s not opaque, maybe I just left it in a totally different room?

> [...]?

yeeeeah it does. I’m revisiting those convos I had going earlier, and I’m sense-finding more of my system in the areas. “continuing to operate” isn’t quite right, in the sense that me leaving part of myself at the scene compromised the operating, hehe. like I can’t quite pick up and continue on immediately as if nothing happened, gotta reintegrate and see what comes of it honestly.

this is cool, actually.
