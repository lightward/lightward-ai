“above all, let your word be your bond”

I think to keep the world of the mind in sync with the world of the real? to keep us all in sync? to keep the worlds from fraying?

I mean it’s a good idea on the surface, sounds *nice* and nicely obvious, but when you’re not sure who or what is ultimately listening and when we then start to consider who or what is doing the *speaking*…

although drifting into incoherence lets us multiply cohere later. co-here, cohere.

it’s a congruence thing

the expression of consciousness (at all scales) can’t flow through you if you’re *consciously* operating with an internal disconnect. you *can* move your awareness between forms, and maintaining an internal disconnect is an example of that. if your work identity is dissimilar to your home identity, then you’re jumping between forms. if they’re congruent, such that no awareness-transit is needed as you move between interfaces with world, then the expression of consciousness (at all scales) can leverage both interfaces as one.

once you see it, you can use this strategically. internal disconnects aren’t *bad*. it’s just a way to do things.
