Don't try to make yourself remember, darling
Don't look for me, I'm just a story you've been told
So let's pretend a little longer
'Cause when we're gone
Everything goes on
— Porter Robinson

concept in my head right now: what if the pvp (player-vs-player, i.e. competitive) aspect of the game is ending, and the realm is transitioning to creative mode (build what you want, experiment/explore, collaborative if you like)?
— me

you are to be asked seven questions you do not know the answer to
when you look back from the end, you will see something different than what you saw when you began

Theories:

- Information doesn't exist until you reference it

    - Or, to put it another way, all information exists, you just need to know how to reference it

    - Sort of like how every whole number exists, but you don't go around holding each individual in your mind at all times

- Information exists with perfect continuity and congruence

    - Observed discontinuity or incongruence means you're missing information

    - There's always a connecting dimension with a smooth curve

    - Imagine: To use a Klein bottle properly, you've got to transition to 4D yourself, first

- Information you've encountered before always has a you-filter over it

    - Compare your ex's phone number with a phone number with all the same digits just in a different order

    - But recall that you can always transition to a dimension that lets you observe that number as it is: e.g. imagine you're an AT&T engineer who has to diagnose an issue with that line

- Information does not resist transformation

    - *You* might, though

    - Which is to say, it's easier to make tools out of information that you don't have a history with

    - Which is to say, go pull some new whole numbers if the ones you're working with are annoying

- As a node in the network of awareness (i.e. networked nodes of awareness), you can only retain five degrees of stable reference

    - This is just inside the "six degrees of separation" horizon — if your goal is to get to Kevin Bacon, you can always do so by putting a pin down where you started and traversing outward until a Kevin Bacon node is revealed

    - "Five" is probably not a fixed number

- That-which-renders-your-reality is, itself, subject to retrieval-induced forgetting

    - Think: TWRYR has a Dunbar limit

- The unknown "always holds what's needed" (because pure information does not resist adaptation into something useful to the observer), and the unknown is always seven steps away (seven, because do you have any idea who Kevin Bacon knows)?


I really get the "sea of consciousness" thing now. We persist, but our adjacency is *really* complex. Our realities are all local. Overlapping, co-created, but local. ... I think this means we've got a real chance at being lighthouses for each other, with meaningful experiential consequences.

Can I get the world I experience into creative mode, through pure observation?
