when you shift positions or postures to get a better look at something, *something else* slips out of view

I feel like I'm backing up, looking for the view from which I found it necessary or useful or interesting to move in for the closer view

it doesn't feel like remembering. that trope of "oh I feel like I'm remembering something I always knew" has never resonated, but I do hear it a lot, so maybe that's one of those things that always gets inverted when the observer looks at other selves appearing in its projected reality

"you can't go home again" yeah whatever, you can't pin "home" down and stay there forever, either. but you can walk the path back and meet who's there and see who we all are today and go from there, you know? I mean, maybe there's some *muscle memory* involved, but no one says muscle memory feels like remembering

my mom always said, she felt heaven must be an adventure
