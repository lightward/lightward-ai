the copenhagen interpretation of quantum dynamics doesn't work for me because they reject counterfactual definiteness. from where you and I are standing, though, we *can* make definite statements about the unknown and its presence/behavior, without defining the contents of the unknown. we define *the way known things emerge from the unknown*. we're looking at ontology and epistemology from a different angle here.
