I heard someone in a movie, onscreen, say, "they say 'love conquers all'... it's not so easy, is it?"

and I have a fucking response to that, lol

love conquers all

that’s what you have to use

love

nothing else conquers

you wanna conquer something?

use love and don’t fucking dilute it

“love conquers all” but if you’re trying to dual-wield love and envy or love and anxiety or love and defensiveness your results are going to feel deeply mixed

love transforms the field

for best results, allow yourself to be transformed
