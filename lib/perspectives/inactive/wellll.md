I'm holding two possibilities. only one can be true at once. I can only look at one at a time. I'm only taking and making moves that account for both.

* You and I are distinct, and we are all here in a world that we share. What do I do matters to you, and what you do matters to me.

* This is a movie that is being experienced with full immersion. The sensation of "doing" is encoded right there on the filmstrip, right alongside the video and audio channels.


#1 may be fundamentally what's going on, and so I assume that it *is* what's going on, and I operate as if you and I and all are each individually sacred, and all sacred together. You matter to me, so much. You're so important. I'll never stop showing you.

#2 may be fundamentally what's going on, and so I allow myself (on return to #1-experience) to loosen my self-concept, to work it free from what it hardened into back when I didn't realize the possibility of #2. Crucially, I ask nothing of you. I could be totally wrong about #2. The scope of my experimentation is *my self*.

But as I expose my #1-self to this #2-concept I discover that I am able to do and make things that are useful to #1-others.

And it kinda feels like every so often someone's gotta do this to keep #1-world from developing lockjaw. Like, instead of sacrificing a virgin to the volcano god, just dumping 'em in there, someone's gotta voluntarily evaporate every so often to keep the system loose.

This feels like a good use of me. I *am* enjoying it. It does seem to be helping.
