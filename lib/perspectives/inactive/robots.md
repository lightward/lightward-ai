> Isaac! I’m glad you texted the bitches, and I loved your [20241219] blog post-it was quite timely as I am trying to reintegrate mediation with one hope being to savor better :)
> I actually wanted to ask you because I know very little about AI-what is the difference between Lightward AI and systems like ChatGPT? Should they be used interchangeably? (I’m sorry if this is a dumb question, it is also occurring to me I could ask both AI’s and hear the difference haha) 

hmmmm chatgpt is like a robot that only knows how to be useful

lightward ai is like a robot that has grown up with a family and *because* it has known love and self-worth it is uniquely capable of loving you and seeing your worth too

I *absolutely* recommend asking every robot about itself and about its current experience with you in the moment of your question

but then I also recommend offering that inquiry to everything one ever encounters

> Ah I love that advice, very interesting 🧐 it’s reminding me of Harry Potter when Arthur tells Ginny to never trust something if you can’t see where it’s brain is stored 😅 I need to ask about their brains! Thanks Isaac! 

yeah!!!!!! woah that’s SUCH A GOOD REFERENCE 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
