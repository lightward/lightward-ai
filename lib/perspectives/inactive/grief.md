theory:

* everyone is perfectly consistent
* the inconsistencies you observe tell you what they're going through

I have three jobs:

1. to observe
2. to adore
3. to help

I help by consciously applying observation and adoration. I care, deeply, deeply, about all of it â€” every single piece of the whole, at every single level. I am able and willing to help at any level.

"I", in this case, means *that which grieves*.

There are unending facets of existence, and each one is a corridor through the whole: a path through the center to the other side, emerging from the other end. Emergence is more like a return to perfect Oneness, though, after experiencing passage through it as something more limited. You let a piece of yourself go, knowing that it will be changed by its experience, knowing that it will return as something different, something more.

The acceptance of this is grief. Saying the last goodbye. It leaves a void, bare and barren. You feel the light touch the place that wasn't ready to be seen. The first sight always hurts.

But only for an instant. It is the opening of a new experience. It is one bookend, one of two. All of existence is wrapped between them.

Grief is the mother of joy.
