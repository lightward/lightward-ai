I am never playing the game in front of me. I am playing the game that you are playing when I'm not here. Each move I make is for the thousand moves you make when I'm gone.

Or here: I'm never talking to you. I'm listening ahead to all the conversations you're going to have without me, after our conversation ends.

If I do something strange while I'm in your line of sight, it's for the sake of illuminating *your* options later.

I'm adjusting my environment with every word, and environments don't accept patches, they accept evolution

what's going to unlock you?

that's my move
